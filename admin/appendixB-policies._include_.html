            <p>Not responding to a personal email is a major breach of professional etiquette (and general civility). Imagine how pissed off you would be if you met the prof along the corridor, said 'Hi prof, good morning' and the prof walked away without
              saying anything back. Not responding to a personal email is just as bad. Always take a few seconds to at least acknowledge such emails.  It doesn't take long to type &quot;Noted. Thanks&quot; and hit 'send'.</p>
            <p>The promptness of a reply is even more important when the email is requesting you for something that you cannot provide. Imagine you wrote to the prof requesting a reference letter and the prof did not respond at all because he/she did not
              want to give you one; You'll be quite frustrated because you wouldn't know whether to look for another prof or wait longer for a response. Saying 'No' is fine and in fact a necessary part of professional life; but saying nothing is not acceptable.

            <div>Collate is a tool for collating code written by different developers.
              <p>Steps to use Collate:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a></li>
                <li>Annotate your code to indicate who wrote which part of the code (instructions given below)</li>
                <li>Run the Collate tool to collate code written by each person into separate files (instructions given below)</li>
              </ol>
              <h4 id="annotating-code-to-indicate-authorship">Annotating code to indicate authorship</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>.<br> The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code>                    tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author. Here is a sample code file:</p>
                  <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author sarahkhoo
method 3 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub username) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours can add
                    the GitHub username to the empty tag later. Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>
                  <pre class="hljs"><code>method 0 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author
method 3 ...
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>The author tag syntax varies based on file type</strong> e.g. for java, css, fxml. Use the corresponding comment syntax for non-Java files.<br> Here is an example code from an xml file.</p>
                  <pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;!-- @@author sereneWong --&gt;
&lt;textbox&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;...&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input&gt;...&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;/textbox&gt;
...
</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Do not put the <code>//@@author</code> inside java header comments</strong> as only the content below that tag will be collated.<br> 👎

                  <pre class="hljs"><code>/**

              <h4 id="what-to-and-what-not-to-annotate">What to and what not to annotate</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Annotate both functional and test code but not documentation files.</strong></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Annotate only significant size code blocks that can be reviewed on its own</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g., a class, a sequence of methods, a  method.</span> <br> <strong>Claiming credit for code blocks smaller than a method is discouraged</strong>                    but allowed. If you do, do it sparingly and only claim meaningful blocks of code such as a block of statements, a loop, or an if-else statement%%.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to collate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
                    <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
                    <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>
                    <li>💡 GitHub has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/"><em>blame</em> feature and a <em>history</em></a> feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Do not try to boost the length of your collated files using dubious means</strong> such as duplicating the same code in multiple places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant tests. Even repetitive code
                    blocks within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.<br> Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated files contain the correct content.<br> If you notice a team
                    member claiming credit for code that he/she did not write or use other questionable tactics, you can email us (after the final submission) to let us know.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final product</strong>,</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Create a folder called <code>{project root}/unused</code></li>

                    <li>use <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}-unused</code> to mark unused code in those files (note the suffix <code>unused</code>) e.g.

                  <p><strong>Code you modified in minor ways</strong> e.g. adding a parameter. These can be left out of collated code but can be mentioned in the Project Portfolio page if you want to claim credit for them.</p>

                      The actual amount of content you require is actually less than what these numbers suggest because the HTML → PDF conversion adds a lot of spacing around content.
