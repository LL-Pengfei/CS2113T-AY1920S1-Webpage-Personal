          <p>CS2103/T prepares you for many higher-level project modules (CS3216/7, CS3203, CS3281/2, etc.), each requiring a slightly different skill set. It is also the only SE course some of you do before going for industry internships. Therefore, we
            have to cover many essential SE concepts/skills and also provide enough exercises for you to practice those skills. This is also why we don't have time to go very deep into any of the topics.</p>
          <p>Remember, everything you learn here is going to be useful in a SE-related career.</p>
          <p>Also, consider this a gradual introduction to 'heavy' modules; most project modules you do after this are going to be much heavier 😛</p>

          <p>Sometimes, small things matter in big ways. e.g., all other things being equal, a job may be offered to the candidate who has the neater looking CV although both have the same qualifications. This may be unfair, but that's how the world works.
            Students forget this harsh reality when they are in the protected environment of the school and tend to get sloppy with their work habits. That is why we reward all positive behavior, even small ones (e.g., following precise submission instructions,
            arriving on time etc.).</p>
          <p>But unlike the real world, we are forgiving. That is why you can still earn full 10 marks of the participation marks even if you miss a few things here and there.</p>

            It also affects fairness of grading.</p>
          <img src="/website-base/admin/images/limited project scope.png" width="772" height="296">
          <p>That is why a strictly-defined project is more suitable for a first course in SE that focuses on nuts-and-bolts of SE. After learning those fundamentals, in higher level project modules you can focus more on the creative side of software projects
            without being dragged down by nuts-and-bolts SE issues (because you already know how to deal with them). However, we would like to allow some room for creativity too. That is why we let you build products that are slight variations of a given
            theme.</p>
          <p>Also note: <strong>The freedom to do 'anything' is not a necessary condition for creativity</strong>. Do not mistake being different for being creative. In fact, the more constrained you are, the more you need creativity to stand out.</p>

          <p>&quot;You tell me exactly what to do - I do that - you pay me (in grades)&quot; is a model for contract work, not for learning. Being able to survive in imprecise, uncertain, volatile problem contexts is precisely what we are trying to teach
            you.</p>
          <p>For example, the best way to communicate something often depends on what is being communicated. That is why we don't specify the precise content for project documents. Instead, we aim to refine project documents iteratively. We believe the learning
            experience will be richer if we let you decide the best way to present your project information rather than just following our instructions blindly. For example, in real-life projects you are rarely told which diagrams to draw; that is a decision
            you have to make yourself.</p>

          <p>We have chosen a basic set of tools after considering ease of learning, availability, typical-ness, popularity, migration path to other tools, etc. There are many reasons for limiting your choices:</p>
          <p>Pedagogical reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sometimes 'good enough', not necessarily the best, tools are a better fit for beginners</strong>: Most bleeding edge, most specialized, or most sophisticated tools are not suitable for a beginner course. After mastering our toolset,
              you will find it easy to upgrade to such high-end tools by yourself. We do expect you to eventually (after this module) migrate to better tools and, having learned more than one tool, to attain a more general understanding about a family
              of tools.</li>
            <li><strong>We want you to learn to thrive under given conditions</strong>: As a professional Software Engineer, you must learn to be productive in any given tool environment, rather than insist on using your preferred tools. It is usually in
              small companies doing less important work that you get to chose your own toolset. Bigger companies working on mature products often impose some choices on developers, such as the project management tool, code repository, IDE, language etc.
              For example, Google used SVN as their revision control software until very recently, long after SVN fell out of popularity among developers. Sometimes this is due to cost reasons (tool licensing cost), and sometimes due to legacy reasons
              (because the tool is already entrenched in their code base).<br> While programming in school is often a solo sport, programming in the industry is a team sport. As we are training you to become professional software engineers, it is important
              to get over the psychological hurdle of needing to satisfy individual preferences and get used to making the best of a given environment.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Practical reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Some of the LOs are tightly coupled to tools. Allowing more tools means tutors need to learn more tools, which increases their workload.</li>
            <li>We provide learning resources for tools. e.g. 'Git guides'. Allowing more tools means we need to produce more resources.</li>
            <li>When all students use the same tool, the collective expertise of the tool is more, increasing the opportunities for you to learn from each others.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Meanwhile, feel free to share with peers your experience of using other tools.</p>

          <p>The high number of submissions is not meant to increase workload but to spread it across the semester. Learning theory and applying them should be done in parallel to maximize the learning effect. That can happen only if we spread theory and

          <p>There are many reasons. One of them is that most of you will be working with existing software in your first few years of the career while hardly any school projects train you to work with existing code bases. We decided to bite the bullet and
            use CS2103/T to train you to work in existing code bases.</p>

          <p>CS2103T communication requirements are limited to a very narrow scope (i.e., communicate about the product to users and developers). CS2101 aims to teach you technical communication in a much wider context. While you may be able to reuse some
