For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part.

            <p><strong>Reduce automated tests</strong> have benefits, but they can be a pain to write/maintain; GUI tests are especially hard to maintain because their behavior can sometimes depend on things such as the OS, resolution etc.<br>
              It is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated tests you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off under the circumstances if tests are slowing you down too much.<br>

                <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests.

                <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests. (Please refer to <em>Expectations on Lines of Code</em> for LoC requirement).</li>
                <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>

                    <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
                    <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                      <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                      <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                      <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                      <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                      <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                      <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>

        <li>Delete existing labels and add the following labels.<br>
          💡 <strong>Issue type</strong> labels are useful from the beginning of the project. The other labels are needed only when you start implementing the features.</li>

        <p><strong>Issue type</strong> labels:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>type.Epic</code> : A big feature which can be broken down into smaller stories e.g. search</li>
          <li><code>type.Story</code> : A user story</li>
          <li><code>type.Enhancement</code>: An enhancement to an existing story</li>

      <h2 id="project-schedule-tracking">Project Schedule Tracking</h2>
      <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the current status of the project. You can also use GitHub's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
      <h3 id="using-issues">Using Issues:</h3>
      <p><big><strong>During the initial stages</strong></big> (latest by the start of v1.2):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong>
            <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span> <code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br>
            <code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Formalize the project plan</strong> by assigning relevant issues to the corresponding milestone.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><big><strong>From milestone v1.2:</strong></big></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Define project tasks as issues</strong>. When you start implementing a user story (or a feature), break it down to smaller tasks if necessary. Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. <mark>Create issues for each</mark> of those tasks so that they can be tracked.<span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>A typical task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="dimmed"><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-down"></span></span> Bad (reasons: not a one-person task, not small enough): <code>Write the Developer Guide</code></span></li>
                <li><span class="dimmed"><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></span></span> Good: <code>Update class diagram in the Developer Guide for v1.4</code></span></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks. Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a single person to do within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="dimmed"><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-down"></span></span> Bad:<code>Implementing parser</code> (reason: too big).</span></li>
                <li><span class="dimmed"><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></span></span> Good:<code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code></span></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Do not track things taken for granted. <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Write a descriptive title for the issue. <span class="dimmed">e.g. <code>Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser</code></span></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Omit redundant details. In some cases, the issue title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the issue description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal description is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.<br><br></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Assign tasks (i.e., issues) to the corresponding team members using the <code>assignees</code> field.</strong> <mark>Normally, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member at any point</mark>.</p>
        </li>

          <p>Optionally, you can use <code>status.ongoing</code> label to indicate issues currently ongoing.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Deadline set for the milestones</strong> (in the GitHub milestone). <span class="dimmed">Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</span></p>

        <p><strong>Wrapping up a Milestone</strong>:<br></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>A working product tagged</strong> with the correct tag (e.g. <code>v1.2</code>) and is pushed to the main repo<br>
              or a <strong>product <em>release</em> done on GitHub</strong>. A product release is optional for v1.2 but required from from v1.3. Click <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/releases/">here</a> to see an example release.</p>
