          <p class="lead"><span>CS2113/T is an introductory Software Engineering module. It covers roughly <strong>a 50-50 balance of basic SE theory and practice</strong> that a student needs to know before going for SE internships in the industry or taking <tooltip content="e.g., CS3203, CS3216/7, CS3281&2, etc.">higher-level project modules</tooltip>. The module follows an <tooltip content="going through SE topics several times while increasing depth, as opposed to going through each topic sequentially"><strong>iterative approach</strong></tooltip> of going increasingly deeper into SE by exposing students to a series of increasingly bigger software projects. The module is notable as one of the rare SE modules that takes a <tooltip content="getting students to learn SE by workin on existing software, as opposed to the green-field approach of getting students to build something from scratch"><strong>brown-field approach</strong> to teaching SE</tooltip>.</span></p>
          <p>On the theory side, this module is supported by a customized online text book <a href="/website-base/se-book-adapted/index.html"><em>Software Engineering for Self-Directed Learners</em></a>, integrated into this module website.</p>
          <p><a href="images/timeline.png"><img src="/website-base/admin/images/timeline.png" width="100%"></a></p>
          <p>The practice side of this module is mainly covered by a team project. Students are expected to take over an existing project <a href="https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4/">AddressBook-Level4 (AB4)</a> -- a relatively small yet non-trivial
            (10 KLoC) generic product -- and enhance it into a better product or evolve it into a different product. To help students to tackle the learning curve of working with 10 KLoC of code, the module takes them through a series of projects of increasing
            size, from AddressBook-Level1(1 KLoC) to AddressBook-Level3(4 KLoC).</p>

          <h3 id="prior-knowledge-java-and-oop">Prior Knowledge: Java and OOP</h3>
          <p>This module requires you to write Java code almost every week, staring from the very first week. If your Java skills are shaky, do brush up your Java programming skills.</p>
          <p>In particular, you may want to <strong>have a look at the new Java 8 features</strong> such as <em>streams</em>, <em>lambdas</em>, <em>Optionals</em>, that may not have been covered in previous Java modules.</p>
          <p>CS2103 students: <mark>This module assumes a reasonable prior knowledge of Java and OOP</mark> because most students taking this module have taken two Java modules before. If you are totally new to Java, you may be better off switching to CS2113
            (Software Engineering &amp; Object-Oriented Programming) instead.</p>
          <h3 id="workload">Workload</h3>
          <p>Given 60% of this module is based on CA, it can appear to be <em>heavy</em>. However, <strong>it is not expected that you will spend more time on this module than its peer modules</strong> <span class="dimmed">(e.g., if this module is core for you, it should not take more time than other level 2 core modules in your program)</span>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Note that the <strong>module contains more things than a typical students can do</strong>, in order to provide enough things for even the strongest students to learn as much as they wish to.</li>
            <li>This means it is <mark><strong>perfectly OK if you don't have time to learn everything the module offers</strong></mark>. Control your workload based on time you spend for the module in a week e.g., 1-1.5 days per week.</li>

                  you feedback on how you are doing (or have done) project tasks so that you can improve further.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Timing/venue:</strong></p>

                <li>You may leave the class 15 minutes before the hour if you have another class right after. There is no need to wait till the tutor dismisses you. However, inform the tutor (as a courtesy) before leaving if you leave before the class is
                  dismissed.</li>
                <li>Please make sure you <mark>vacate the table 5 minutes before the hour</mark> so that the next group can start on time.</li>
                <li>In the past many students have suggested to increase the tutorial duration because 1 hour is barely enough to get through all weekly LOs. Increasing the tutorial time is not possible due to lack of venues and tutors. Instead, let's try
                  to make the best of the one hour available by coming well prepared and starting on time.</li>

                  something else.<br> ❗️ This is a high-risk high-reward option because morphing requires extra work but a morphed product may earn more marks than an optimized product of similar complexity.</p>

          <h2 id="project-constraints">Project → Constraints</h2>
          <p>Your project should comply with the following constraints.
            <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason</strong>: to increase comparability among projects and to maximize applicability of module learning outcomes in the project.</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Constraint-Morph</strong>: The final product should be a result of morphing the given code base. i.e. enhance and/or evolve the given code to arrive at the new software. However, you are allowed to replace all existing code with
                new code, as long as it is done incrementally. <span class="dimmed">e.g. one feature/component at a time</span><br>
                <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> To ensure your code has a decent quality level from the start.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Constraint-Incremental</strong>: The product needs to be developed incrementally over the project duration. While it is fine to do less in some weeks and more in other weeks, a reasonably consistent delivery rate is expected. For
                example, it is not acceptable to do the entire project over the recess week and do almost nothing for the remainder of the semester. <span class="dimmed">Reasons: 1. To simulate a real project where you have to work on a code base over a long period, possibly with breaks in the middle. 2. To learn how to deliver big features in small increments.</span></p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <span id="constraint-cli">
<ul>
<li><strong>Constraint-CLI</strong>: Command Line Interface is the primary mode of input. The GUI should be used primarily to give visual feedback to the user rather than to collect input. Some minimal use of mouse is OK (e.g. to click the minimize button), but the primary input should be command-driven.
<ul>
<li>Mouse actions should have keyboard alternatives.</li>
<li>Typing is preferred over key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse actions or key combinations.</li>
<li><tooltip content="typing the full command and hitting ENTER will complete the task">One-shot commands</tooltip> are preferred over <tooltip content="prompting the user to input one parameter at a time">multi-step commands</tooltip>. If you provide a multi-step command to help new users, you should also provide a one-shot equivalent for regular users. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: We want the user to be able to accomplish tasks faster using CLI than a GUI; having to enter commands part-by-part will slow down the user.</span></li>
          <li>❗️ While we don't prohibit
            <tooltip content="i.e. no CLI equivalent">GUI-only</tooltip> features, such features will be ignored during grading.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Constraint-Human-Editable-File</strong>: The data should be stored locally and should be in a human editable text file.<br>
                <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> To allow advanced users to manipulate the data by editing the data file.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Constraint-OO</strong>: The software should follow the Object-oriented paradigm.<br>
                <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> For you to practice using OOP in a non-trivial project.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Constraint-No-DBSM</strong>: Do not use a
                <tooltip content="Database Management System e.g., MySQL">DBMS</tooltip> to store data.<br>
                <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> Using a DBMS to store data will reduce the room to apply OOP techniques to manage data. It is true that most real world systems use a DBMS, but given the small size of this project, we need to optimize it for CS2113 module learning outcomes; learning DBMS-related LOs will have to be left to database modules or level 3 project modules.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Constraint-Platform-Independent</strong>: The software should work on the Windows, Linux, and OS-X platforms. Even if you are unable to manually test the app on all three platforms, consciously avoid using OS-dependent libraries
                and OS-specific features.<br>
                <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> Peer testers should be able to use any of these platforms.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Constraint-No-Installer</strong>: The software should work without requiring an installer. Having an optional installer is OK as long as the portable (non-installed) version has all the critical functionality.<br>
                <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> We do not want to install all your projects on our testing machines when we test them for grading.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Constraint-External-Software</strong>: The use of third-party frameworks/libraries is allowed but only if they,</p>
              <ul>
                <li>are free.</li>
                <li>do not require any installation by the user of your software.</li>

              </ul>
              <p>and is subjected to prior approval by the teaching team.<br>
                <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> We will not allow third-party software that can interfere with the learning objectives of the module.</span></p>
              <p>Please <mark>post in the <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2113-BASE/forum/issues">forum</a> your request to use a third-party libraries</mark> <em>before</em> you start using the library. Once a specific library has been approved for one

            <li>
              <p>All team members should be in the same tutorial. <mark>Delay forming teams until your place in a tutorial is confirmed.</mark> We do not allow changing tutorials to team up with your preferred team mates.</p>

              <p>No more than one exchange students per team <span class="dimmed">Rationale: to increase interaction between exchange students and NUS students.</span></p>

            <li>
              <p>Gender balanced teams are encouraged. While all-male teams may be unavoidable at times (due to high male percentage in the cohort), all-female teams are highly discouraged.</p>

            up your tech skills in preparation for the project. <code>AB4</code> is to be used as the basis for your project.</p>
          <p><code>AB4</code> is the version you will use as the starting point for your final project. Some of the work you do in <code>AB1</code> to <code>AB3</code> can be ported over to <code>AB4</code> and can be used to claim credit in the final project.</p>

                        <li>based on the nature/scale of contacts <span class="dimmed"> e.g. huge number of contacts (for HR admins, user group admins), mostly incomplete contacts, highly volatile contact details, contacts become inactive after a specific period (e.g. contract employees)</span></li>
                        <li>based on what users do with the contacts <span class="dimmed"> e.g. organize group events, share info, do business, do analytics</span></li>

                    <p><strong>[Direction 2] <em>Morph</em></strong> AddressBook into a different product: Given that AddressBook is a generic app that manages a type of elements (i.e. contacts), you can use it as a starting point to create an app that manages
                      something else.<br> ❗️ This is a high-risk high-reward option because morphing requires extra work but a morphed product may earn more marks than an optimized product of similar complexity.</p>

                <p>For either direction, you need to define a target user profile and a value proposition:</p>

                    <p><strong>Target user profile</strong>: Define a very specific target user profile. <br> 💡 We require you narrow down the target user profile <span class="dimmed"> as opposed to trying to make it as general as possible. Here is an example direction of narrowing down target user: anybody → teachers → university teachers → tech savvy university teachers → CS2113 instructors.</span><br><br>                      ❗️ Be careful not to contradict given project constraints when defining the user profile <span class="dimmed"> e.g. the target user should still prefer typing over mouse actions</span>.<br><br>
                      <strong>It is expected that your product will be optimized for the chosen target users</strong> <span class="dimmed">i.e., add features that are especially/only applicable for target users (to make the app especially attractive to them). w.r.t. the example above, there can be features that are applicable to CS2113 instructors only, such as the ability to navigate to a student's project on GitHub</span>                      💡 Your project will be graded based on how well the features match the target user profile and how well the features fit-together.</p>

                        <li>It minimizes the overlap between features of different teams which can cause plagiarism issues. Furthermore, higher the number of other teams having the same features, less impressive your work becomes especially if others have
                          done a better job of implementing that feature.

              <div>
                <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br> Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with
                      others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong> Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>                      When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br> When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation
                      details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>
                  </ul>
                </tip-box>

                  <code>As a user I can find upcoming tasks, so that I can decide what needs to be done soon.</code><br>
                  <code>As a user I can delete a task, so that I can get rid of tasks that I no longer care to track.</code><br>
                  <code>As a new user I can view more information about a particular command, so that I can learn how to use various commands.</code><br>
                  <code>As an advanced user I can use shorter versions of a command, so that type a command faster.</code></p>

                <p>Suggested workflow:</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Take one user story at a time and get team member opinions about it.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Based on the team consensus, put the story (i.e. the piece of paper) onto one of these three piles:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><code>Must-Have</code> : The product will be practically useless to the target user without this feature.</li>
                      <li><code>Nice-To-Have</code> : The target user can benefit from this user story significantly but you are not certain if you'll have time to implement it.</li>
                      <li><code>Not-Useful</code> : No significant benefit to the target user, or does not fit into the product vision.</li>

                <p>Document the following items using a convenient format (e.g., a GoogleDoc). <span class="dimmed">Do not spend time on formatting the content nicely; reason: these will be ported to the actual Developer Guide in your project repo later.</span><br>                  💡 Some examples of these can be found in the <a href="https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html#product-scope">AB4 Developer Guide</a>.</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>User Guide</strong>:<br> Draft a user guide in a convenient format (e.g., a GoogleDoc) to describe what the product would be like when it is at 2.0. We recommend that you follow the existing
                  <tooltip content="AddressBook-Level4">AB4</tooltip> User Guide in terms of structure and format.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>💡 It is highly recommended that you <strong>divide documentation work (in the User Guide and the Developer Guide) among team members based on enhancements/features each person would be adding</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g., If you are the person planing to add a feature X, you should be the person to describe the feature X in the User Guide and in the Developer Guide</span>.
                    For features that are not planned to be implemented by v1.4, you can divide them based on who will be implementing them <em>if</em> the project were to continue until v2.0 (hypothetically).</p>
                  <p><span class="dimmed">Reason: In the final project evaluation your documentation skills will be graded based on sections of the User/Developer Guide you have written.</span></p>
                </tip-box>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Suggested length</strong>: Follow the existing user guide and developer guides in terms of the level of details.</p>
            <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Save your draft a single pdf file, name it <code>{Your Team ID}.pdf</code> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>W09-3.pdf</code></span> and upload to IVLE.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>After the v2.0 is conceptualized, decide which features each member will do by v1.4. <span class="dimmed">We realize that it will be hard for you to estimate the effort required for each feature as you are not familiar with the code base. Nevertheless, come up with a project plan as per your best estimate; this plan can be revised at later stages. It is better to start with <em>some</em> plan rather than no plan at all. If in doubt, choose to do <em>less</em> than <em>more</em>; we don't expect you to deliver a lot of big features.</span></li>
              <li>Divide each of those features into three increments, to be released at v1.1, v1.2, v1.3 (v1.4 omitted deliberately as a buffer). Ideally, each increment should deliver a end-user testable enhancement.</li>
              <li>Document the above two items somewhere e.g., in a Google doc/sheet</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Include in the pdf file you upload to IVLE.</p>

                          <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
                          <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                          <ol>
                            <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                            <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                            <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                            <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                            <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                            <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                            <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to
                              their own fork.</li>

                      <p>Automated tests have benefits, but they can be a pain to write/maintain; GUI tests are especially hard to maintain because their behavior can sometimes depend on things such as the OS, resolution etc.</p>
                      <p>It is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated test coverage you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off under the circumstances
                        if tests are slowing you down too much. There is no direct penalty for removing GUI tests.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the
                      higher the risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
                    <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
                    <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide
                      to what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
                    <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional
                      code because the code has low testability.</li>

                  <h2 id="project-schedule-tracking">Project Schedule Tracking</h2>
                  <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect
                    the current status of the project. You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong>
                        <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span> <code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br>
                        <code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></p>

                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks.</strong> Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
                      <ul>

                      <p><strong>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks.</strong> Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a single person to do within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>

                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Do not track things taken for granted.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track.

                      <p><strong>Omit redundant details.</strong> In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks.
                        A minimal description is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</p>

                <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect
                  the current status of the project. You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
                <h3 id="using-issues-2">Using Issues:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong>
                      <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span> <code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br>
                      <code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks.</strong> Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><span class="dimmed">👍 Good: Update class diagram in the project manual for v1.4</span></li>
                      <li><span class="dimmed">👎 Bad (reasons: not a one-person task, not small enough): Write the project manual</span></li>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks.</strong> Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a single person to do within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><code>Implementing parser</code>  <span class="dimmed">: too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week.</span></li>
                      <li><code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code> <span class="dimmed">: appropriate size.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Do not track things taken for granted.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Omit redundant details.</strong> In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks.
                      A minimal description is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Assign tasks to team members using the <code>assignees</code> field.</strong> At any point, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</p>

              <p>💡 We use a tool called <em>Collate</em> to extract out code written by each member in your final project submission. The tool requires you to annotate code with special tags to mark code written by you. Adding those annotations is usually
                done at v1.3 but you are welcome to start early.</p>
              <panel header="**How to collate code for grading**" no-close="">
                <div>Collate is a tool for collating code written by different developers.
                  <p>Steps to use Collate:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a></li>
                    <li>Annotate your code to indicate who wrote which part of the code (instructions given below)</li>
                    <li>Run the Collate tool to collate code written by each person into separate files (instructions given below)</li>

              <div>Collate is a tool for collating code written by different developers.
                <p>Steps to use Collate:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a></li>
                  <li>Annotate your code to indicate who wrote which part of the code (instructions given below)</li>
                  <li>Run the Collate tool to collate code written by each person into separate files (instructions given below)</li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>.<br> The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code>                      tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author. Here is a sample code file:</p>

                  <li>
                    <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub username) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours can
                      add the GitHub username to the empty tag later. Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>

                    <p><strong>The author tag syntax varies based on file type</strong> e.g. for java, css, fxml. Use the corresponding comment syntax for non-Java files.<br> Here is an example code from an xml file.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Freeze features</strong> around this time. Ensure the current product have all the features you intend to release at v1.4. Adding major changes after this point is risky. The remaining time is better spent fixing problems discovered
              late or on fine-tuning the product.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong><big>Product:</big></strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Consider increasing code coverage by adding more tests if it is lower than the level you would like it to be. Take note of
              <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:mid-v14-testingExpectations">our expectation on test code</trigger>.</li>
            <li>After you have sufficient code coverage, fix remaining code quality problems and bring up the quality to your target level.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher
                  the risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
                <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
                <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide
                  to what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
                <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional
                  code because the code has low testability.</li>

                  <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Strictly <code>(teamSize x 3) + 1</code> minutes <span class="dimmed"> e.g. 17 minutes for a 5-person team.</span> Exceeding this limit will be penalized. The extra minute is for the first speaker to give an

                <li>
                  <p><strong>Target audience</strong>: Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level manager of your company, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of the product. This is the first time they are seeing the new product you developed
                    but they are familiar with the AddressBook-level4 (AB4) product.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Scope</strong>:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Each person should demo the enhancements they added</strong>. However, it's ok for one member to do all the typing.</li>
                    <li>Subjected to the constraint mentioned in the previous point, as far as possible, organize the demo to present a cohesive picture of the product as a whole, presented in a logical order. <span class="dimmed"> Remember to explain the profile of the target user profile and value proposition early in the demo.</span></li>
                    <li>It is recommended you showcase how the feature improves the user’s life rather than simply describe each feature.</li>
                    <li>No need to cover design/implementation details as the manager is not interested in those details.</li>
                    <li>Mention features you inherited from AB4 only if they are needed to explain your new features. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: existing features will not earn you marks, and the audience is already familiar with AB4 features.</span></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Demo the product using the same executable you submitted, on your own laptop, using the TV.</li>
                    <li>It can be <strong>a <em>sitting down</em> demo</strong>: You'll be demonstrating the features using the TV while sitting down. But you may stand around the TV if you prefer that way.</li>
                    <li>It will be uninterrupted demo: The audience members will not interrupt you during the demo. That means you should finish within the given time.</li>
                    <li>The app should be populated with a significant amount of realistic data at the start. <span class="dimmed"> e.g at least 20 contacts</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dress code</strong> : The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Optimizing the time:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product. Not recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or lengthy narrations.<br> Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales
                      pitch or an informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don’t need to act like an imaginary user. For example, [Instead of this]<code>Jim get’s a call from boss. &quot;Ring ring&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.</code>                      [do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …</code><br> It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t have enough time for it.<br> Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different
                      context → Different requirements.</li>
                    <li>Rehearse the steps well and ensure you can do a smooth demo. Poor quality demos can affect your grade.</li>
                    <li>Don’t waste time repeating things the target audience already knows. e.g. no need to say things like &quot;We are students from NUS, SoC&quot;.</li>
                    <li>Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the system. You should not plan to type all the sample data during the demo itself. On the other hand, trying to demo a product using just 1-2 sample data creates
                      a bad impression too.</li>
                    <li>Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to perform a task before you show the full command with all the bells
                      and whistles.</li>
                    <li>Limit the demo to CLI inputs only. There is no point explaining GUI inputs because they don't earn marks.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

          <span id="project-deliverables-executable">
<ul>
<li>The product should be delivered as an executable jar file.</li>
<li>Ideally, the product delivered at v1.4 should be a <tooltip content=" i.e., it can be used by end-users"><em>releasable</em></tooltip> product. However, in the interest of lowering your workload, we do not penalize if the product is <tooltip content="i.e., the product is not usable by end-users because some essential features are missing">not releasable</tooltip>, <mark>as long as the product is <tooltip content="i.e., the features it has can be tested from an end-user perspective"><em>acceptance testable</em></tooltip></mark>.

<ul>
<li>The source code should match the executable, and should include the revision history of the source code, as a Git repo.

          <span id="project-deliverables-ug">
<ul>
<li>The User Guide (UG) of the product should match the proposed v2.0 of the product and in sync with the current version of the product.</li>
<li>Features not implemented yet should be clearly marked as <code>Coming in v2.0</code></li>
<li>Ensure the UG matches the product precisely, as it will be used by peer testers (and <mark>any inaccuracy in the content will be considered bugs</mark>).

          <h3 id="deliverable-developer-guide-ug">Deliverable: Developer Guide (UG)</h3>
          <span id="project-deliverables-dg">
<ul>
<li>The Developer Guide (DG) of the product should match the proposed v2.0 of the product and should be in sync with the current version of the product.</li>
<li>❗️ <strong>The appendix named <em>Instructions for Manual Testing</em></strong> of the Developer Guide should include testing instructions to <strong>cover all your major and minor enhancements</strong>. There is no need to add testing instructions for existing features if you did not touch them.<br>
💡 What to include in the appendix <em>Instructions for Manual Testing</em>? This appendix is meant to give some guidance to the tester to chart a path through the features, and provide some important test inputs the tester can copy-paste into the app. There is no need to give a long list of test cases including all possible variations. It is upto the tester to come up with those variations. However, if the instructions are inaccurate or deliberately misses/mis-states information to make testing harder <span class="dimmed"> i.e. annoys the tester</span>,
          the tester can report it as a bug <span class="dimmed"> (because flaws in developer docs are considered as bugs)</span>.</li>
          <li>Ensure the DG matches the product precisely, as it will be used by peer evaluators (and <mark>any inaccuracy in the content will be considered bugs</mark>).</li>

<li>
<p>If you are uncomfortable posting your photo due to security reasons, you can post a lower resolution image so that it is hard for someone to misuse that image for fraudulent purposes.

<p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For you to use <span class="dimmed"> (e.g. in your resume)</span> as a well-documented data point of your SE experience</li>
          <li>For us to use as a data point to evaluate your,

            <p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Main things to include:
                <ul>
                  <li>links to collated code</li>
                  <li>features you implemented <span class="dimmed"> (include relevant extracts from the user guide and the developer guide)</span></li>
                  <li>features you propose to implement in future <span class="dimmed"> (include relevant extracts from the user guide and the developer guide if applicable)</span><br> Note: the purpose of allowing you to include <em>proposed</em> features
                    is to provide you more flexibility to show your documentation skills. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. you can bring in a proposed feature just to give you an opportunity to use a UML diagram type not used by the actual features.</span></li>
                  <li>other significant contributions to the project <span class="dimmed"> e.g. tweaks to existing features, setting up project tools</span></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Other things you can include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Evidence of helping others <span class="dimmed"> e.g. responses you posted in our forum, bugs you reported in other team's products</span>,</li>
                  <li>Evidence of technical leadership <span class="dimmed"> e.g. offering features for others to reuse, evidence of those features being reused by others</span></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>If you plan to use the PPP in your Resume, you can also include your SE work outside of the module (will not be graded)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Format</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Page limit: If you have more content than the limit given below, shorten (or omit some content) so that you do not exceed the page limit. Having too much content in the PPP will be viewed unfavorably during grading. Note: the <mark>page limits given below are <em>after</em> converting to PDF format</mark>.
                The actual amount of content you require is actually less than what these numbers suggest because the HTML → PDF conversion adds a lot of spacing around content.

          <span id="project-deliverables-demo">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Strictly <code>(teamSize x 3) + 1</code> minutes <span class="dimmed"> e.g. 17 minutes for a 5-person team.</span> Exceeding this limit will be penalized. The extra minute is for the first speaker to give an overview
          of the product.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Target audience</strong>: Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level manager of your company, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of the product. This is the first time they are seeing the new product you developed but
              they are familiar with the AddressBook-level4 (AB4) product.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Scope</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Each person should demo the enhancements they added</strong>. However, it's ok for one member to do all the typing.</li>
              <li>Subjected to the constraint mentioned in the previous point, as far as possible, organize the demo to present a cohesive picture of the product as a whole, presented in a logical order. <span class="dimmed"> Remember to explain the profile of the target user profile and value proposition early in the demo.</span></li>
              <li>It is recommended you showcase how the feature improves the user’s life rather than simply describe each feature.</li>
              <li>No need to cover design/implementation details as the manager is not interested in those details.</li>
              <li>Mention features you inherited from AB4 only if they are needed to explain your new features. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: existing features will not earn you marks, and the audience is already familiar with AB4 features.</span></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Demo the product using the same executable you submitted, on your own laptop, using the TV.</li>
              <li>It can be <strong>a <em>sitting down</em> demo</strong>: You'll be demonstrating the features using the TV while sitting down. But you may stand around the TV if you prefer that way.</li>
              <li>It will be uninterrupted demo: The audience members will not interrupt you during the demo. That means you should finish within the given time.</li>
              <li>The app should be populated with a significant amount of realistic data at the start. <span class="dimmed"> e.g at least 20 contacts</span>.</li>
              <li><strong>Dress code</strong> : The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Optimizing the time:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product. Not recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or lengthy narrations.<br> Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales pitch
                or an informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don’t need to act like an imaginary user. For example, [Instead of this]<code>Jim get’s a call from boss. &quot;Ring ring&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.</code>                [do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …</code><br> It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t have enough time for it.<br> Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different
                context → Different requirements.</li>
              <li>Rehearse the steps well and ensure you can do a smooth demo. Poor quality demos can affect your grade.</li>
              <li>Don’t waste time repeating things the target audience already knows. e.g. no need to say things like &quot;We are students from NUS, SoC&quot;.</li>
              <li>Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the system. You should not plan to type all the sample data during the demo itself. On the other hand, trying to demo a product using just 1-2 sample data creates a bad
                impression too.</li>
              <li>Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to perform a task before you show the full command with all the bells and
                whistles.</li>
              <li>Limit the demo to CLI inputs only. There is no point explaining GUI inputs because they don't earn marks.</li>

          <p><strong>Bug Review Period</strong>:</p>
          <p>There will be a review period for you to respond to the <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2113-BASE/pe-results/issues">bug reports</a> you received.</p>
          <p>Duration: The review period will start around 1 day after the PE (exact time to be announced) and will last until the following <strong>Wednesday midnight</strong>.</p>
          <p>Bug reviewing is recommended to be done as a team as some of the decisions need team consensus.</p>

            <p><strong>Instructions for Reviewing Bug Reports</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>First, don't freak out if there are lot of bug reports.</strong> Many can be duplicates and some can be <em>false positives</em>. In any case, we anticipate that all of these products will have some bugs and our penalty for bugs
                  is not harsh. Furthermore, it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Do not edit the subject or the description. Do not close bug reports.</strong> Your response (if any) should be added as a comment.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>If the bug is reported multiple times</strong>, mark all copies EXCEPT one as duplicates using the <code>duplicate</code> tag. In addition, use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-duplicate-issues-and-pull-requests/">this technique</a>                  to indicate which issue they are duplicates of. Duplicates can be omitted from processing steps given below.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>If a bug seems to be for a different product</strong> (i.e. wrongly assigned to your team), let us know (email prof).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Decide if it is a real bug and apply ONLY one of these labels</strong>.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><code>response.Accepted</code> : You accept it as a bug.</li>
                <li><code>response.Rejected</code> : What tester thought as a bug is in fact expected behavior. ❗️ The penalty for rejecting a bug using an unjustifiable explanation is higher than the penalty if the same bug was accepted. You can also reject
                  bugs that you inherited from AB4.</li>
                <li><code>response.CannotReproduce</code> : You are unable to reproduce the behavior reported in the bug after multiple tries.</li>

                <p><strong>Decide who should fix the bug</strong>. Use the <code>Assignees</code> field to assign the issue to that person(s). There is no need to actually fix the bug though. It's simply an indication/acceptance of responsibility. <strong>If there is no assignee and we are unable to determine a suitable assignee ourselves, we'll have no choice but to distribute the penalty for that bug (if any) among all team members.</strong></p>
              </li>

                                    <p><strong>Among various dimensions of code quality, such as run-time efficiency, security, and robustness, one of the most important is understandability.</strong> This is because in any non-trivial software project,
                                      code needs to be read, understood, and modified by other developers later on. Even if we do not intend to pass the code to someone else, code quality is still important because we all become 'strangers' to our own
                                      code someday.</p>

                                          <ul>
                                            <li><strong>We may not know which parts are the real performance bottlenecks</strong>. This is especially the case when the code undergoes transformations (e.g. compiling, minifying, transpiling, etc.) before it
                                              becomes an executable. Ideally, you should use a profiler tool to identify the actual bottlenecks of the code first, and optimize only those parts.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Optimizing can complicate the code</strong>, affecting correctness and understandability</li>
                                            <li><strong>Hand-optimized code can be harder for the compiler to optimize</strong> (the simpler the code, the easier for the compiler to optimize it). In many cases a compiler can do a better job of optimizing
                                              the runtime code if you don't get in the way by trying to hand-optimize the source code.</li>
                                          </ul>
                                          <p>A popular saying in the industry is <strong><em>make it work, make it right, make it fast</em></strong> which means in most cases getting the code to perform correctly should take priority over optimizing it.
                                            If the code doesn't work correctly, it has no value on matter how fast/efficient it it.</p>

                                          <p>The happy path (i.e. the execution path taken when everything goes well) should be clear and prominent in your code. Restructure the code to make the happy path unindented as much as possible. It is the ‘unusual’
                                            cases that should be indented. Someone reading the code should not get distracted by alternative paths taken when error conditions happen. One technique that could help in this regard is the use of <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?GuardClause">guard clauses</a>.</p>

This also applies to the final <code>else</code> of an <code>if-else</code> construct. That is, the final <code>else</code> should mean 'everything else', and not the final option.
                                            Do not use <code>else</code> when an <code>if</code> condition can be explicitly specified, unless there is absolutely no other possibility.</p>

                                    <p>Some think commenting heavily increases the 'code quality'. This is not so. Avoid writing comments to explain bad code. Improve the code to make it self-explanatory.</p>

                <p>Bug reviewing is recommended to be done as a team as some of the decisions need team consensus.</p>

                  <p><strong>Instructions for Reviewing Bug Reports</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>First, don't freak out if there are lot of bug reports.</strong> Many can be duplicates and some can be <em>false positives</em>. In any case, we anticipate that all of these products will have some bugs and our penalty for
                        bugs is not harsh. Furthermore, it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Do not edit the subject or the description. Do not close bug reports.</strong> Your response (if any) should be added as a comment.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>If the bug is reported multiple times</strong>, mark all copies EXCEPT one as duplicates using the <code>duplicate</code> tag. In addition, use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-duplicate-issues-and-pull-requests/">this technique</a>                        to indicate which issue they are duplicates of. Duplicates can be omitted from processing steps given below.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>If a bug seems to be for a different product</strong> (i.e. wrongly assigned to your team), let us know (email prof).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Decide if it is a real bug and apply ONLY one of these labels</strong>.</p>

                        reject bugs that you inherited from AB4.</li>
                      <li><code>response.CannotReproduce</code> : You are unable to reproduce the behavior reported in the bug after multiple tries.</li>
                      <li><code>response.IssueUnclear</code> : The issue description is not clear.</li>

                        <li><code>severity.Medium</code> : A flaw that causes occasional inconvenience to some users but they can continue to use the product.</li>
                        <li><code>severity.High</code> : A flaw that affects most users and causes major problems for users. i.e., makes the product almost unusable for most users.</li>

                      <p><strong>Decide who should fix the bug</strong>. Use the <code>Assignees</code> field to assign the issue to that person(s). There is no need to actually fix the bug though. It's simply an indication/acceptance of responsibility.
                        <strong>If there is no assignee and we are unable to determine a suitable assignee ourselves, we'll have no choice but to distribute the penalty for that bug (if any) among all team members.</strong></p>

                <ul>
                  <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher
                    the risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
                  <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
                  <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide
                    to what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
                  <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional
                    code because the code has low testability.</li>

          <p>We use the <a href="http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/">TEAMMATES</a> online peer evaluation system to conduct several rounds of peer-evaluations. All peer evaluations will be taken into account when determining your participation marks. The system

<ul>
<li>❗️ Submitting peer evaluations is compulsory. <mark>If you routinely miss submitting peer evaluations, you can lose participation marks.</mark></li>

In this module, we encourage (but not require) you to login to TEAMMATES using your Google account and complete your profile with a <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:peerEvaluations-suitablePhoto">suitable profile photo</trigger>. <span class="dimmed">Reason: CS2113 is a big class.

              <li><strong>Quality</strong>: Does not deliver work products that seem to be below the student's competence level i.e. tries their best to make the work product as high quality as possible within her competency level.</li>

          <span id="giving-peer-feedback">
<p>Giving constructive feedback to others is a valuable skill for software engineers. It is also an intended learning outcome of this module. Half-hearted/trivial feedback will not earn participation marks.</p>
<p>Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume you are giving feedback to a colleague, not a friend. Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.</li>
<li>The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback (e.g. <code>Thanks for all the hard work!</code> and negative ratings (e.g. <code>Equal share - 40%</code>) to the same team member is not being honest.</li>
<li>State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she did not improve as expected). However, this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.</li></ul></span>
          <p>The final peer evaluation (in week 13) is graded. In that peer-evaluation you will be asked to evaluate the work of your team members and another team. The quality and accuracy of your evaluation will affect your grade and your evaluations will
            be considered as a data point in determining the grade of the team members.</p>

If you do, do it sparingly and only claim meaningful blocks of code such as a block of statements, a loop, or an if-else statement%%.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to collate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
                    <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
                    <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>

          <p>There is no midterm.</p>
          <p>The final exam has two parts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Part 1: MCQ questions (1 hour, 20 marks)</li>
            <li>Part 2: Essay questions (1 hour, 20 marks)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Both papers will be given to you at the start but you need to <strong>answer Part 1 first</strong> (i.e. MCQ paper). It will be <strong>collected 1 hour after the exam start time</strong> (even if arrived late for the exam). You are free to
            start part 2 early if you finish Part 1 early.</p>
          <h2 id="final-exam-part-1-mcq">Final Exam: Part 1 (MCQ)</h2>
          <p>Each MCQ question gives you a statement to evaluate.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> An example statement</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Testing is a Q&amp;A activity</p>
            </blockquote>
          </tip-box>
          <p>Unless stated otherwise, the meaning of answer options are<br>
            <strong>A.</strong> <code>True</code><br>
            <strong>B.</strong> Option not used<br>
            <strong>C.</strong> <code>Question unclear</code> (in this case, write down your doubt in the question paper)<br>
            <strong>D.</strong> Option not used<br>
            <strong>E.</strong> <code>False</code></p>
          <p>The exam paper has 100 questions.</p>
          <p>Note that you have <strong>slightly more than ½ minute for each question</strong>, which means you need to go through the questions fairly quickly.</p>
          <p>Given the fast pace required by the paper, to be fair to all students, <strong>you will not be allowed to clarify doubts about questions</strong> (in Part 1) by talking to invigilators.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If a question is not clear, you can choose option C and write your doubt in the exam paper, near the unclear question.</li>
            <li>If your doubt is justified (e.g. there is a typo in the question) or if many students found the question to be unclear, the examiner may decide to omit that question from grading.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Questions in Part 1 are confidential.</strong> You are not allowed to reveal Part 1 content to anyone after the exam. All pages of the assessment paper are to be returned at the end of the exam.</p>
          <p>You will be given OCR forms to indicate your answers for Part 1. As each OCR form can accommodate only 50 answers, you will be given 2 OCR forms. <strong>Indicate your student number in both OCR forms</strong>.</p>
          <p>To save space, we use the following notation in MCQ question.
            <strong>[<ins>x</ins> | y | <ins>z</ins>] means ‘x and z, but not y’</strong></p>
          <tip-box>
            <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> SE is [boring | <ins>useful</ins> | <ins>fun</ins>] means <em>SE is not boring</em> AND <em>SE is useful</em> AND <em>SE is fun</em>.</p>
            <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Consider the following statement:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>IDEs can help with [<ins>writing</ins> | debugging | <ins>testing</ins>] code.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The correct response for it is <code>False</code> because IDEs can help with all three of the given options, not just writing and testing.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p>Some questions will use <ins>underlines</ins> or <mark>highlighting</mark> to draw your attention to a specific part of the question. That is because those parts are highly relevant to the answer and we don’t want you to miss the relevance of
            that part.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Consider the statement below:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Technique ABC <ins>can</ins> be used to generate more test cases.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The word <ins>can</ins> is underlined because the decision you need to make is whether the ABC <em>can or cannot</em> be used to generate more test cases; the decision is not whether ABC can be used to generate <em>more or better</em> test
              cases.</p>
          </tip-box>
          <p>Markers such as the one given below appears at left margin of the paper to <strong>indicate where the question corresponds to a new column in the OCR form</strong>. E.g. questions 11, 21, 31, etc. (a column has 10 questions). Such markers can
            help you to detect if you missed a question in the previous 10 questions. You can safely ignore those markers if you are not interested in making use of that additional hint.</p>
          <p><img src="/website-base/admin/images/columnMarker.png"><br></p>
          <p>Some questions have tags e.g., the question below has a tag <strong><code>JAVA</code></strong>. These <strong>tags provide additional context about the question</strong>. In the example below, the tag indicates that the code given in the question
            is Java code.</p>
          <p><img src="/website-base/admin/images/contextTag.png"><br></p>
          <p><strong>The paper is open-book</strong>: you may bring any printed or written materials to the exam in hard copy format. However, given the fast pace required by Part 1, you will not have time left to refer notes during that part of the exam.</p>
          <p>💡 <strong>Mark the OCR form as you go</strong>, rather than planning to transfer your answers to the OCR form near the end. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: Given there are 130+ questions, it will be hard to estimate how much time you need to mass-transfer all answers to OCR forms.</span></p>
          <p>💡 <strong>Write the answer in the exam paper as well</strong> as marking it in the OCR form. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: It will reduce the chance of missing a question. Furthermore, in case you missed a question, it will help you correct the OCR form quickly.</span></p>
          <p>💡 We have tried to <strong>avoid deliberately misleading/tricky questions</strong>. If a question seems to take a very long time to figure out, you are probably over-thinking it.</p>
          <h2 id="final-exam-part-2-essay">Final Exam: Part 2 (Essay)</h2>
          <p>Unlike in part 1, <strong>you can ask invigilators for clarifications</strong> if you found a question to be unclear in part 2.</p>
          <p>Yes, <strong>you may use pencils</strong> when answering part 2.</p>

          <p><strong>We learn together, NOT compete against each other.</strong></p>
          <p>You are not in a competition. Our grading is not forced on a bell curve.</p>
          <p>Learn from each other. That is why we open-source your submissions.</p>
          <p>Teach each other, even those in other teams. Those who do it well can become tutors next time.</p>
          <p><strong>Continuously engage, NOT last minute heroics.</strong></p>
          <p>We want to train you to do software engineering in a steady and repeatable manner that does not require 'last minute heroics'.</p>
          <p>In this module, last minute heroics will not earn you a good project grade, and last minute mugging will not earn you a good exam grade.</p>
          <p><strong>Where you reach at the end matters, NOT what you knew at the beginning.</strong></p>
          <p>When you start the module, some others in the class may appear to know a lot more than you. Don't let that worry you. The final grade depends on what you know at the end, not what you knew to begin with. All marks allocated to intermediate deliverables
            are within the reach of everyone in the class irrespective of their prior knowledge.</p>

                    without saying anything back. Not responding to a personal email is just as bad. Always take a few seconds to at least acknowledge such emails.  It doesn't take long to type &quot;Noted. Thanks&quot; and hit 'send'.</p>
                  <p>The promptness of a reply is even more important when the email is requesting you for something that you cannot provide. Imagine you wrote to the prof requesting a reference letter and the prof did not respond at all because he/she did
                    not want to give you one; You'll be quite frustrated because you wouldn't know whether to look for another prof or wait longer for a response. Saying 'No' is fine and in fact a necessary part of professional life; but saying nothing
                    is not acceptable. If you didn't reply, the sender will not even know whether you received the email.</p>

                  <div>Collate is a tool for collating code written by different developers.
                    <p>Steps to use Collate:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a></li>
                      <li>Annotate your code to indicate who wrote which part of the code (instructions given below)</li>
                      <li>Run the Collate tool to collate code written by each person into separate files (instructions given below)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4 id="annotating-code-to-indicate-authorship-4">Annotating code to indicate authorship</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>.<br> The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code>                          tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author. Here is a sample code file:</p>
                        <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author sarahkhoo
method 3 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub username) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours
                          can add the GitHub username to the empty tag later. Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>
                        <pre class="hljs"><code>method 0 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author
method 3 ...
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p><strong>The author tag syntax varies based on file type</strong> e.g. for java, css, fxml. Use the corresponding comment syntax for non-Java files.<br> Here is an example code from an xml file.</p>
                        <pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;!-- @@author sereneWong --&gt;

If you do, do it sparingly and only claim meaningful blocks of code such as a block of statements, a loop, or an if-else statement%%.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to collate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
                          <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
                          <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>
                          <li>💡 GitHub has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/"><em>blame</em> feature and a <em>history</em></a> feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.</li>

                          code blocks within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.<br> Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated files contain the correct content.<br> If you notice
                          a team member claiming credit for code that he/she did not write or use other questionable tactics, you can email us (after the final submission) to let us know.</p>

                  we have to cover many essential SE concepts/skills and also provide enough exercises for you to practice those skills. This is also why we don't have time to go very deep into any of the topics.</p>

                <p>Sometimes, small things matter in big ways. e.g., all other things being equal, a job may be offered to the candidate who has the neater looking CV although both have the same qualifications. This may be unfair, but that's how the world
                  works. Students forget this harsh reality when they are in the protected environment of the school and tend to get sloppy with their work habits. That is why we reward all positive behavior, even small ones (e.g., following precise submission
                  instructions, arriving on time etc.).</p>
                <p>But unlike the real world, we are forgiving. That is why you can still earn full 10 marks of the participation marks even if you miss a few things here and there.</p>

                <p>Defining your own unique project is more fun.</p>
                <p>But, wider scope → more diverse projects → harder for us to go deep into your project. The collective know-how we (i.e., students and the teaching team) have built up about SE issues related to the project become shallow and stretched
                  too thinly. It also affects fairness of grading.</p>

                <p>That is why a strictly-defined project is more suitable for a first course in SE that focuses on nuts-and-bolts of SE. After learning those fundamentals, in higher level project modules you can focus more on the creative side of software
                  projects without being dragged down by nuts-and-bolts SE issues (because you already know how to deal with them). However, we would like to allow some room for creativity too. That is why we let you build products that are slight variations
                  of a given theme.</p>
                <p>Also note: <strong>The freedom to do 'anything' is not a necessary condition for creativity</strong>. Do not mistake being different for being creative. In fact, the more constrained you are, the more you need creativity to stand out.</p>

                <p>For example, the best way to communicate something often depends on what is being communicated. That is why we don't specify the precise content for project documents. Instead, we aim to refine project documents iteratively. We believe

                <p>We have chosen a basic set of tools after considering ease of learning, availability, typical-ness, popularity, migration path to other tools, etc. There are many reasons for limiting your choices:</p>
                <p>Pedagogical reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Sometimes 'good enough', not necessarily the best, tools are a better fit for beginners</strong>: Most bleeding edge, most specialized, or most sophisticated tools are not suitable for a beginner course. After mastering our toolset,
                    you will find it easy to upgrade to such high-end tools by yourself. We do expect you to eventually (after this module) migrate to better tools and, having learned more than one tool, to attain a more general understanding about a
                    family of tools.</li>
                  <li><strong>We want you to learn to thrive under given conditions</strong>: As a professional Software Engineer, you must learn to be productive in any given tool environment, rather than insist on using your preferred tools. It is usually
                    in small companies doing less important work that you get to chose your own toolset. Bigger companies working on mature products often impose some choices on developers, such as the project management tool, code repository, IDE, language
                    etc. For example, Google used SVN as their revision control software until very recently, long after SVN fell out of popularity among developers. Sometimes this is due to cost reasons (tool licensing cost), and sometimes due to legacy
                    reasons (because the tool is already entrenched in their code base).<br> While programming in school is often a solo sport, programming in the industry is a team sport. As we are training you to become professional software engineers,
                    it is important to get over the psychological hurdle of needing to satisfy individual preferences and get used to making the best of a given environment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Practical reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Some of the LOs are tightly coupled to tools. Allowing more tools means tutors need to learn more tools, which increases their workload.</li>
                  <li>We provide learning resources for tools. e.g. 'Git guides'. Allowing more tools means we need to produce more resources.</li>
                  <li>When all students use the same tool, the collective expertise of the tool is more, increasing the opportunities for you to learn from each others.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Meanwhile, feel free to share with peers your experience of using other tools.</p>

          <ul>

              <p><strong>Check what is given</strong>: Check if the problem/concept has been discussed in the lectures, text book, or the list of resources given to you. Yes it is easier for you to write an email to the tutor/lecturer instead, but that shouldn't
                be your default behavior. We know that sometimes it is difficult to find stuff in the resources we have provided. But you should try first.</p>

              <p><strong>Search</strong>: It is very likely the answer already exists somewhere in the cyberspace. Almost every programming-related question has been answered in places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Don't give

              <p><strong>Ask the world</strong> using programming forums such as stackoverflow.</p>
              <p>Here are some tips for posting help request:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>PLEASE search for existing answers before you post your question in those public forums; You don't want to appear as a 'clueless' or 'too lazy to do your research' person in a public forum.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Learn to isolate the problem. &quot;My code doesn't work&quot; isn't going to help even if you post the whole code online. Others don't have time to go through all of your code. Isolate the part that doesn't work and strip it down to
                    the bare minimum that is enough reproduce the error. Sometimes, this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself. If not, at least it increases the chance of someone else being able to help you.</p>
                  <tip-box>
                    <p>💡 How to isolate problematic code? Delete code (one bit at a time) that is confirmed as not related to the problem. Do that until you can still reproduce the problem with the least amount of code remaining.</p>
                  </tip-box>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Generalize the problem. &quot;How to write tasks to a text file using Java&quot; is too specific to what you are working on. You are more likely to find help if you post a thread called (or search for) &quot;How to write to a file using
                    Java&quot;.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Explain well. Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything that is relevant to your problem, your chances of getting an answer in the first try is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they can
                    help you, it will take longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much information into the thread either.</p>
                  <tip-box>

<li><strong>Raise your question during a tutorial</strong>. Some questions can be discussed with the tutor and tutorial-mates.
What kind of questions are suitable to discuss with the tutor? Consider these two questions you might want to ask a tutor:
<ul>
<li>✅ <em>This is how I understood/applied coupling. Is that correct?</em> - Such questions are welcome. <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason</strong>:This question shows you have put in some effort to learn the topic and seeking further clarification from the tutor.</span></li>
          <li>🚫 <em>What is coupling?</em> - Such questions are discouraged. <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason</strong>: This question implies you haven’t done what you could to learn the topic in concern.</span></li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks.</strong> Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span class="dimmed">👍 Good: Update class diagram in the project manual for v1.4</span></li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks.</strong> Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a single person to do within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><code>Implementing parser</code>  <span class="dimmed">: too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week.</span></li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Do not track things taken for granted.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Omit redundant details.</strong> In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal
                  description is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Assign tasks to team members using the <code>assignees</code> field.</strong> At any point, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</p>
              </li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-milestones/">GitHub milestones</a> to indicate which issues are to be handled for which milestone by assigning issues to suitable milestones.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Set the deadlines for milestones (in GitHub). Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Note that you can change the milestone plan along the way as necessary.</p>

              <p><strong>Wrapping up a Milestone</strong>:<br>
                <mark>Here are the conditions to satisfy for a milestone to be considered properly wrapped up</mark>:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>A working product tagged with the correct tag (e.g. v1.2) is pushed to the main repo.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>All tests passing on Travis for the version tagged above.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Milestone updated to match the product i.e. all issues completed and PRs merged for the milestone should be assigned to the milestone.<br>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Milestone closed. If there are incomplete issues or unmerged PRs in the milestone, move them to a future milestone.<br>
                    <img src="/website-base/admin/images/closingMilestones.png" width="700"></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Optionally, issues for the next milestone are assigned to team members (this is not compulsory to do <em>before</em> the tutorial, but we recommend you to do it soon after the tutorial).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Optionally, future milestones are revised based on what you experienced in the current milestone <span class="dimmed"> e.g. if you could not finish all issues assigned to the current milestone, it is a sign that you overestimated how much you can do in a week, which means you might want to reduce the issues assigned to future milestones to match that observation</span>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Doing a 'release' on GitHub is optional for v1.1 and v1.2 but compulsory from v1.3.</p>

          <p>If your team is facing difficulties due to differences in skill/motivation /availability among team members,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>First, do not expect everyone to have the same skill/motivation level as you.</strong> It is fine if someone wants to do less and have low expectations from the module. That doesn't mean that person is a bad person. Everyone is entitled
                to have their own priorities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Second, don't give up.</strong> It is unfortunate that your team ended up in this situation, but you can turn it into a good learning opportunity. You don't get an opportunity to save a sinking team every day 😃</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Third, if you care about your grade and willing to work for it, you need to take initiative</strong> to turn the situation around or else the whole team is going to suffer. Don't hesitate to take charge if the situation calls for
                it. By doing so, you'll be doing a favor for your team. Be professional, kind, and courteous to the team members, but also be firm and assertive. It is your grade that is at stake. Don't worry about making a bad situation worse. You won't
                know until you try.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Finally, don't feel angry or 'wronged'.</strong> Teamwork problems are not uncommon in this module and we know how to grade so that you will not be penalized for others' low contribution. We can use Git to find exactly what others
                did. It's not your responsibility to get others to contribute.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Given below are some suggestions you can adopt if the project work is not going smooth due to team issues. Note that the below measures can result in some team members doing more work than others and earning better project grades than others.
            It is still better than sinking the whole team together.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Redistribute the work</strong>: Stronger programmers in the team should take over the critical parts of the code.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Enforce stricter integration workflow</strong>: Appoint an integrator (typically, the strongest programmer). His/her job is to maintain the integrated version of the code. He/she should not accept any code that breaks the existing
                product or is not up to the acceptable quality standard. It is up to others to submit acceptable code to the integrator. Note that if the integrator rejected your code unreasonably, you can still earn marks for that code. You are allowed
                to submit such 'rejected' code for grading. They can earn marks based on the quality of the code.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>If you have very unreliable or totally disengaged team members</strong> :</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Re-allocate to others any mission-critical work allocated to that person so that such team members cannot bring down the entire team.</li>
            <li>However, do not leave out such team members from project communications. Always keep them in the loop so that they can contribute any time they wish to.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, evaluate them sincerely and fairly during peer evaluations so that they do get the grade their work deserves, no more, no less.</li>
            <li>Be courteous to such team members too. Some folks have genuine problems that prevent them from contributing more although they may not be able tell you the reasons. Just do your best for the project and assume everyone else is doing their
              best too, although their best may be lower than yours.</li>
