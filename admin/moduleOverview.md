<p class="lead"><md>{{ module_pair }} is an introductory Software Engineering module. It covers roughly **a 50-50 balance of basic SE theory and practice** that a student needs to know before going for SE internships in the industry or taking <tooltip content="e.g., CS3203, CS3216/7, CS3281&2, etc.">higher-level project modules</tooltip>. The module follows an <tooltip content="going through SE topics several times while increasing depth, as opposed to going through each topic sequentially">**iterative approach**</tooltip> of going increasingly deeper into SE by exposing students to a series of increasingly bigger software projects. The module is notable as one of the rare SE modules that takes a <tooltip content="getting students to learn SE by workin on existing software, as opposed to the green-field approach of getting students to build something from scratch">**brown-field approach** to teaching SE</tooltip>.</md></p>

On the theory side, this module is supported by a customized online textbook [_Software Engineering for Self-Directed Learners_]({{ baseUrl }}/se-book-adapted/index.html), integrated into this module website.

The practice side of this module is mainly covered by a team project. Students are expected to take over an existing project [AddressBook-Level4 (AB4)](https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4/) -- a relatively small yet non-trivial (10 KLoC) generic product -- and enhance it into a better product or evolve it into a different product. To help students tackle the learning curve of working with 10 KLoC of code, the module takes them through a series of projects of increasing size, from AddressBook-Level1(1 KLoC) to AddressBook-Level3(4 KLoC).

Given below is a summary of what the module covers and does not cover.

Topic | {{ icon_tick_green }} Covered | {{ icon_x_red }} Not covered
------|---------|------------
Java | Used heavily, but not taught | syntax %%(reason: expected prerequisite knowledge)%%
OOP | Used in a non-trivial project, <tooltip content="e.g., Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle">intermediate OOP principles</tooltip> | basics %%(reason: expected prerequisite knowledge)%%
SE tools/practices | <tooltip content="e.g., revision control, continuous integration, practices, test automation, code reviews, pull requests">those typically used in a mature, high-rigor SE project</tooltip> | those specific to start-ups</md></td>
Modeling | <tooltip content="e.g., class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams">Some UML notations</tooltip> (sufficient to be able to describe SE artifacts using models, such as seen in [this Developer Guide of AB4](https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html#design)) | intensive <tooltip content="creating detailed UML models before strating to code">upfront design modeling</tooltip>
Requirements | <tooltip content="e.g., user stories, use cases">Some lightweight techniques</tooltip> to gather and document project requirements | rapid prototyping, heavy UI design, designing a product from scratch
Documentation | Documentation targeting end users ([example](https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4/UserGuide.html)) as well as those targeting developers ([example](https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html)) | Marketing materials
Project Management | Iterative delivery of a product, working collaboratively with team members, on-site as well as remotely | Setting up project infrastructure from scratch
Testing | <tooltip content="e.g., automated unit/integration/system testing">basic developer testing</tooltip> and <tooltip content="e.g., acceptance testing">user testing</tooltip> | <tooltip content="e.g., security testing, performance testing, usability testing">testing for non-functional aspects</tooltip>
Applications domains | Cross-platform desktop applications | Web programming, Mobile programming, Database programming
