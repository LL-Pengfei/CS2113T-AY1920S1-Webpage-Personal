    <p>We use the <a href="http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/">TEAMMATES</a> online peer evaluation system to conduct several rounds of peer-evaluations.
      All peer evaluations will be taken into account when determining your participation marks. The system also allows you to give anonymous feedback to your teammates.</p>

Therefore, you should choose a recent individual photo showing your face clearly (i.e., not too small) -- somewhat similar to a passport photo. Some examples can be seen in the 'Teaching team' page. Given below are some examples of good and bad profile photos.<br>

    <span id="giving-peer-feedback">
      <p>Giving constructive feedback to others is a valuable skill for software engineers. It is also an intended learning outcome of this module. Half-hearted/trivial feedback will not earn participation marks.</p>
      <p>Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assume you are giving feedback to a colleague, not a friend. Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.</li>
        <li>The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback (e.g. <code>Thanks for all the hard work!</code> and negative ratings (e.g. <code>Equal share - 40%</code>) to the same team member is not being honest.</li>
        <li>State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she did not improve as expected). However, this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.</li>
      </ul>
