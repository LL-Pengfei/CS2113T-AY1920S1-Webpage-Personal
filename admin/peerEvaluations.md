We use the [TEAMMATES](http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/) online peer evaluation system to conduct several rounds of peer-evaluations.
All peer evaluations will be taken into account when determining your participation marks. The system also allows you to give anonymous feedback to your teammates.

<span id="extra-requirements">

**Extra Requirements:** [considered for participation marks]

* {{ icon_important_big_red }} Submitting peer evaluations is compulsory. ==If you routinely miss submitting peer evaluations, you can lose participation marks.==
* :bulb: TEAMMATES normally allows students to access it without using Google login. In this module, we encourage (but not require) you to login to TEAMMATES using your Google account and complete your profile with a <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:peerEvaluations-suitablePhoto">suitable profile photo</trigger>. %%Reason: {{ module_pair }} is a big class. This profile helps us to remember you better, even after the module is over.%%

<span id="giving-peer-feedback">

Giving constructive feedback to others is a valuable skill for software engineers. It is also an intended learning outcome of this module. Half-hearted/trivial feedback will not earn participation marks.

Here are some things to keep in mind:

* Assume you are giving feedback to a colleague, not a friend. Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.
* The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback (e.g. `Thanks for all the hard work!` and negative ratings (e.g. `Equal share - 40%`) to the same team member is not being honest.
* State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she did not improve as expected). However, this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.
