          💡 What to include in the appendix <em>Instructions for Manual Testing</em>? This appendix is meant to give some guidance to the tester to chart a path through the features, and provide some important test inputs the tester can copy-paste into the app. There is no need to give a long list of test cases including all possible variations. It is upto the tester to come up with those variations. However, if the instructions are inaccurate or deliberately misses/mis-states information to make testing harder <span class="dimmed"> i.e. annoys the tester</span>, the tester can report it as a bug <span class="dimmed"> (because flaws in developer docs are considered as bugs)</span>.

          <ul>
            <li>Before taking the screenshot, populate the product with data that makes the product look good. For example, if the product is supposed to show photos, use real photos instead of dummy placeholders.</li>
            <li>It should show a state in which the product is well-populated <span class="dimmed">i.e., don't leave data panels largely blank</span></li>
            <li>Choose a state that showcase the main features of the product <span class="dimmed">i.e., the login screen is not usually a good choice</span></li>
            <li>Avoid annotations (arrows, callouts, explanatory text etc.); it should look like the product is being in use for real.</li>

            <li>The <mark>page limits given above are <em>after</em> converting to PDF format</mark>. The actual amount of content you require is actually less than what these numbers suggest because the HTML → PDF conversion adds a lot of spacing around content.</li>
            <li><span class="dimmed">Reason for page limit: These submissions are peer-graded (in the PE) which needs to be done in a limited time span.</span><br>
              If you have more content than the limit given above, you can give a representative samples of UG and DG that showcase your documentation skills. Those samples should be understandable on their own. For the parts left-out, you can give an abbreviated version and refer the reader to the full UG/DG for more details.<br>
              <span class="dimmed">It's similar to giving extra details as appendices; the reader will look at the UG/DG if the PPP is not enough to make a judgment. For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part. There is no guarantee that the evaluator will read the full document.</span></li>

    <h3 id="deliverable%3A-demo">Deliverable: Demo</h3>
    <span id="project-deliverables-demo">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Strictly 18 minutes for a 5-person team and 15 minutes for a 4-person team. Exceeding this limit will be penalized. Any set up time will be taken out of your allocated time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Target audience</strong>: Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level manager of your company, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of the product. This is the first time they are seeing the new product you developed but they are familiar with the AddressBook-level4 (AB4) product. The actual audience are the evaluators (the team supervisor and another tutor).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Scope</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Each person should demo the enhancements they added</strong>. However, it's ok for one member to do all the typing.</li>
            <li>Subjected to the constraint mentioned in the previous point, as far as possible, organize the demo to present a cohesive picture of the product as a whole, presented in a logical order. <span class="dimmed"> Remember to explain the profile of the target user profile and value proposition early in the demo.</span></li>
            <li>It is recommended you showcase how the feature improves the user’s life rather than simply describe each feature.</li>
            <li>No need to cover design/implementation details as the manager is not interested in those details.</li>
            <li>Mention features you inherited from AB4 only if they are needed to explain your new features. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: existing features will not earn you marks, and the audience is already familiar with AB4 features.</span></li>
            <li>Each person should demo their features.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Demo the product using the same executable you submitted, on your own laptop, using the TV.</li>
            <li>It can be <strong>a <em>sitting down</em> demo</strong>: You'll be demonstrating the features using the TV while sitting down. But you may stand around the TV if you prefer that way.</li>
            <li>It will be an uninterrupted demo: The audience members will not interrupt you during the demo. That means you should finish within the given time.</li>
            <li>The demo should use a sufficient amount of <tooltip content="`Mr aaa` is not a realistic person name"><em>realistic</em></tooltip> demo data. <span class="dimmed"> e.g at least 20 contacts</span>. Trying to demo a product using just 1-2 sample data creates a bad impression.</li>
            <li><strong>Dress code</strong> : The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Optimizing the time:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product. Not recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or lengthy narrations.<br>
              Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales pitch or an informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don’t need to act like an imaginary user. For example, [Instead of this] <code>Jim get’s a call from boss. &quot;Ring ring&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.</code> [do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …</code>
              It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t have enough time for it.<br>
              Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different context → Different requirements.</li>
            <li>Rehearse the steps well and ensure you can do a smooth demo. Poor quality demos can affect your grade.</li>
            <li>Don’t waste time repeating things the target audience already knows. e.g. no need to say things like &quot;We are students from NUS, SoC&quot;.</li>
            <li>Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to perform a task before you show the full command with all the bells and whistles.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Special circumstances:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>If a significant feature was not merged on time: inform the evaluator and get permission to show the unmerged feature using your own version of the code. Unmerged features earn much less marks than a merged equivalent but something is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>If you have no user visible features to show, you can still contribute to the demo by giving an overview of the product (at the start) and/or giving a wrap of of the product (at the end).</li>
            <li>If you are unable to come to the demo due to a valid reason, you can ask a team member to demo your feature. Remember to submit the evidence of your excuse <span class="dimmed">e.g., MC</span> to prof. The demo is part of module assessment and <mark>absence without a valid reason</mark> will cause you to lose marks.</li>

          <h4 id="processing-pe-bug-reports%3A">Processing PE Bug Reports:</h4>
          <p>There will be a review period for you to respond to the <a href="https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S2/pe-results/issues">bug reports</a> you received.</p>
          <p>Duration: The review period will start around 1 day after the PE (exact time to be announced) and will last until the following <strong>Monday midnight</strong>. However, you are recommended to finish this task ASAP, to minimize cutting into your exam preparation work.</p>
          <p>Bug reviewing is recommended to be done as a team as some of the decisions need team consensus.</p>
          <tip-box>
            <p><strong>Instructions for Reviewing Bug Reports</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>First, don't freak out if there are lot of bug reports.</strong> Many can be duplicates and some can be <em>false positives</em>. In any case, we anticipate that all of these products will have some bugs and our penalty for bugs is not harsh. Furthermore, it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Do not edit the subject or the description.</strong> Your response (if any) should be added as a comment.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>You may (but not required to) close the bug report after you are done processing it, as a convenient means of separating the 'processed' issues from 'not yet processed' issues.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>If the bug is reported multiple times</strong>, mark all copies EXCEPT one as duplicates using the <code>duplicate</code> tag (if the duplicates have different severity levels, you should <mark>keep the one with the highest severity</mark>). In addition, <mark>use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-duplicate-issues-and-pull-requests/">this technique</a> to indicate which issue they are duplicates of</mark>. Duplicates can be omitted from processing steps given below.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>If a bug seems to be for a different product</strong> (i.e. wrongly assigned to your team), let us know (email prof).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Decide if it is a real bug and apply ONLY one of these labels</strong>.</p>
              </li>

                <p>Response Labels:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><code>response.Accepted</code>: You accept it as a bug.</li>
                  <li><code>response.NotInScope</code>: It is a valid issue but not something the team should be penalized for e.g., it was not related to features delivered in v1.4.</li>
                  <li><code>response.Rejected</code>: What tester treated as a bug is in fact the expected behavior. <font color="red"><big><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span></big></font> The may lose marks for rejecting a bug without an explanation or using an unjustifiable explanation. This penalty is higher than the penalty if the same bug was accepted. You can reject bugs that you inherited from AB4.</li>
                  <li><code>response.CannotReproduce</code>: You are unable to reproduce the behavior reported in the bug after multiple tries.</li>
                  <li><code>response.IssueUnclear</code>: The issue description is not clear. Don't post comments asked the tester to give more info. The tester will not be able to see those comments because the bug reports are anonymized.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li><code>type.FeatureFlaw</code>: some functionality missing from a feature delivered in v1.4 in a way that the feature becomes less useful to the intended target user for normal usage. i.e., the feature is not 'complete'. In other words, an acceptance testing bug that falls within the scope of v1.4 features. These issues are counted against the 'depth and completeness' of the feature.</li>
                  <li><code>type.FunctionalityBug</code>: the bug is a flaw in how the product works.</li>
                  <li><code>type.DocTypo</code>: A minor spelling/grammar error in the documentation. Does not affect the user.</li>
                  <li><code>type.DocumentationBug</code>: A flaw in the documentation that can potentially affect the user <span class="dimmed">e.g., a missing step, a wrong instruction</span></li>

                    <li><code>severity.Medium</code> : A flaw that causes occasional inconvenience to some users but they can continue to use the product.</li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Assign owners for the rejected bugs as well</strong>. If the bug is incorrectly rejected, the penalty will apply to only the owner, if no owner is assigned, the penalty will be distributed to the team.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>We recommend (but not enforce) that the feature owner should be assigned bugs related to the feature, even if the bug was caused indirectly by someone else. Reason: The feature owner should have defended the feature against bugs using automated tests and defensive coding techniques.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Add an explanatory comment</strong> explaining your choice of labels and assignees.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>We recommend choosing <code>type.*</code>, <code>severity.*</code> and assignee even for bugs you are not accepting. Reason: your <em>non-acceptance</em> may be rejected by the tutor later, in which case we need to grade it as an accepted bug.</p>

                  If you have more content than the limit given above, you can give a representative samples of UG and DG that showcase your documentation skills. Those samples should be understandable on their own. For the parts left-out, you can give an abbreviated version and refer the reader to the full UG/DG for more details.<br>
                  <span class="dimmed">It's similar to giving extra details as appendices; the reader will look at the UG/DG if the PPP is not enough to make a judgment. For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part. There is no guarantee that the evaluator will read the full document.</span></li>

      <p>There will be a review period for you to respond to the <a href="https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S2/pe-results/issues">bug reports</a> you received.</p>
      <p>Duration: The review period will start around 1 day after the PE (exact time to be announced) and will last until the following <strong>Monday midnight</strong>. However, you are recommended to finish this task ASAP, to minimize cutting into your exam preparation work.</p>
      <p>Bug reviewing is recommended to be done as a team as some of the decisions need team consensus.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p><strong>Instructions for Reviewing Bug Reports</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>First, don't freak out if there are lot of bug reports.</strong> Many can be duplicates and some can be <em>false positives</em>. In any case, we anticipate that all of these products will have some bugs and our penalty for bugs is not harsh. Furthermore, it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Do not edit the subject or the description.</strong> Your response (if any) should be added as a comment.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>You may (but not required to) close the bug report after you are done processing it, as a convenient means of separating the 'processed' issues from 'not yet processed' issues.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>If the bug is reported multiple times</strong>, mark all copies EXCEPT one as duplicates using the <code>duplicate</code> tag (if the duplicates have different severity levels, you should <mark>keep the one with the highest severity</mark>). In addition, <mark>use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-duplicate-issues-and-pull-requests/">this technique</a> to indicate which issue they are duplicates of</mark>. Duplicates can be omitted from processing steps given below.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>If a bug seems to be for a different product</strong> (i.e. wrongly assigned to your team), let us know (email prof).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Decide if it is a real bug and apply ONLY one of these labels</strong>.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><code>response.Accepted</code>: You accept it as a bug.</li>
              <li><code>response.NotInScope</code>: It is a valid issue but not something the team should be penalized for e.g., it was not related to features delivered in v1.4.</li>
              <li><code>response.Rejected</code>: What tester treated as a bug is in fact the expected behavior. <font color="red"><big><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span></big></font> The may lose marks for rejecting a bug without an explanation or using an unjustifiable explanation. This penalty is higher than the penalty if the same bug was accepted. You can reject bugs that you inherited from AB4.</li>
              <li><code>response.CannotReproduce</code>: You are unable to reproduce the behavior reported in the bug after multiple tries.</li>
              <li><code>response.IssueUnclear</code>: The issue description is not clear. Don't post comments asked the tester to give more info. The tester will not be able to see those comments because the bug reports are anonymized.</li>

            <p>We recommend (but not enforce) that the feature owner should be assigned bugs related to the feature, even if the bug was caused indirectly by someone else.

            <p>We recommend choosing <code>type.*</code>, <code>severity.*</code> and assignee even for bugs you are not accepting. Reason: your <em>non-acceptance</em> may be rejected by the tutor later, in which case we need to grade it as an accepted bug.</p>

    <span id="notes-for-ab23">
      <p>There is no explicit penalty for switching to a lower level AB. All projects are evaluated based on the same yardstick irrespective of on which AB it is based. As an AB is given to you as a 'free' head-start, a lower level AB gives you a shorter head-start, which means you may have to set up certain things by yourself. Nevertheless, you should switch to AB2/3 if you feel you can learn more from the project that way, as our goal is to maximize learning, not features.<br>
        If your team wants to stay with AB-4 but you want to switch to a lower level AB, let the us know so that we can work something out for you.</p>
      <p>If you have opted to use AB-2 or AB-3 instead of AB-4 as the basis of your product, please note the following points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set up <a href="https://nuscs2113-ay1819s2.github.io/addressbook-level4/UsingTravis.html#enabling-auto-publishing-of-documentation">auto-publishing of documentation similar to AB-4</a></li>
        <li>Add Project Portfolio Pages (PPP) for members, similar to the example provided in AB-4</li>
        <li>You can convert UG, DG, and PPP into pdf files using <a href="https://nuscs2113-ay1819s2.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html#converting-documentation-to-pdf-format">instructions provided in AB-4 DG</a></li>
        <li>Create an <em>About Us</em> page similar to AB-4 and update it as described in <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:deliverables-midv11">mid-v1.1 progress guide</trigger>

                                      The <code>//@@author</code> tag should indicates the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code> tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author.
                                      Here is a sample code file:</p>

                                    <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub username) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours can add the GitHub username to the empty tag later.
                                      Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>
                                    <pre class="hljs"><code>method 0 ...

That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part.

                            It is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated tests you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off under the circumstances if tests are slowing you down too much.<br>
                            There is no direct penalty for removing GUI tests. Also note <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:appEworkflow-testingExpectations">our expectation on test code</trigger>.</p>

                              <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
                              <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                              <ol>
                                <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                                <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                                <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                                <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                                <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                                <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                                <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>
                              </ol>
