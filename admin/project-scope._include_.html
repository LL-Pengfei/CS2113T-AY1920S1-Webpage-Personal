    <h3 id="project-phases">Project phases</h3>
    <p>The project will run in two phases.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In Phase 1, you will be working individually to develop the foundation of your codebase
        <ul>
          <li>This will give you an opportunity to familiarize with Java programming</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In Phase 2, as a team, you will enhance the project, building on the codebase of Phase 1</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      <div data-included-from="E:\Teaching\CS2113\CS2113-AY1920Sem1\website\book\projectDuke\text.md">
        <p>The project consists of the following <em>increments</em>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Levels</strong>: A series of features, meant to be added to Duke in the given order, although some can be skipped. These have been named <code>Level 1</code> to <code>Level 10</code> to indicate how the features make the product progressively &quot;level up&quot;.</li>
          <li><strong>Extensions:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><big><span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary">Category A</span></big> These are internal/feature enhancements meant to help you practice a specific Java or an SE technique.</li>
              <li><big><span class="badge badge-pill badge-info">Category B</span></big> These are enhancements related to task tracking.</li>
              <li><big><span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">Category C</span></big> These are enhancements, not specifically related to task tracking.</li>
              <li><big><span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Category D</span></big> Each of these adds the ability to track another type of entities.</li>

      </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4 id="phase-1">Phase 1</h4>
    <p>Phase 1 comprises Levels 1 to 10 with some <span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary">Category A</span> and <span class="badge badge-pill badge-info">Category B</span> extensions.</p>
    <h4 id="phase-2">Phase 2</h4>
    <p>In Phase 2, each of you will develop one enhancement each from <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">Category C</span> and <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Category D</span>.<br>
      However, you need to ensure that the overall product is cohesive in nature, which means, as a team, you need to decide on a few things before embarking on developing the enhancements. <br>
      The following sections may help you decide on the enhancements.</p>
    <h3 id="project-direction">Project Direction</h3>
    <div id="project-direction">
      In general, each team is expected to take one of these two directions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>[Direction 1] <em>Optimize</em></strong> the task manager for a more specific target user group: <br></p>
          <p>After Phase 1 of the project, think about optimizing your project to suite a specific target user group when you implement <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">Category C</span> and <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Category D</span> enhancements.</p>
          <panel type="seamless" header="%%<md>:fas-cube:</md> Examples for the _optimize_ direction%%">
            <p>A task manager:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>for users in a specific profession <span class="dimmed">Â e.g. doctors, salesmen, teachers, etc.</span></li>
              <li>based on the nature and scale of application <span class="dimmed">Â e.g. huge number of tasks (user group admins), highly volatile task list, for users who organize group events etc.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
          </panel>
          <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>[Direction 2] <em>Morph</em></strong> the task manager into a different product: <br></p>
          <p>Given that <em>Duke</em> provides capabilities to manage certain types of elements (i.e., tasks), you can use it as a starting point to create an app that manages something else in Phase 2. Model the <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">Category C</span> and <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Category D</span> enhancements to cater to the new app that you want to develop.</p>
          <panel type="seamless" header="%%<md>:fas-cube:</md> Examples for the _morph_ direction%%">
            <p>An app to manage:</p>
            <ul>

              <li>Thing to memorize i.e. flash cards, trivia</li>
              <li>Forum posts, news feeds, Social media feeds</li>
              <li>Online projects or issue trackers that the user is interested in</li>
              <li>Emails, possibly from different accounts</li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="target-user-profile-and-value-proposition">Target user profile and value proposition</h4>
      <p>For either direction, you need to define a target user profile and a value proposition:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Target user profile</strong>: Define a very specific target user profile. <br> ðŸ’¡ We require you to narrow down the target user profile <span class="dimmed">Â as opposed to trying to make it as general as possible. Here is an example direction of narrowing down target user: anybody â†’ teachers â†’ university teachers â†’ tech savvy university teachers â†’ CS2113/T instructors.</span><br><br>
            <font color="red"><big><span aria-hidden="true" class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span></big></font> Be careful not to contradict given <a href="/website/admin/project-constraints.html">project constraints</a> when defining the user profile <span class="dimmed">Â e.g. the target user should still prefer typing over mouse actions</span>.<br><br>
            <strong>It is expected that your product will be optimized for the chosen target users</strong> <span class="dimmed">i.e., add features that are especially/only applicable for target users (to make the app especially attractive to them). w.r.t. the example above, there can be features that are applicable to CS2113/T instructors only, such as the ability to navigate to a student's project on GitHub</span><br>
            ðŸ’¡ Your project will be graded based on how well the features match the target user profile and how well the features fit-together.

            <ul>

              <li>It minimizes the overlap between features of different teams which can cause plagiarism issues. Furthermore, higher the number of other teams having the same features, less impressive your work becomes especially if others have done a better job of implementing that feature.

    <span id="individual-expectations">
      <h5 id="individual-expectations-on-features">[Individual] Expectations on Features</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>You are expected to add at least one feature each from <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">Category C</span> and <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Category D</span> enhancements to the product.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>At lest one feature should be end-user visible and end-user testable. <span class="dimmed">Reason: If your feature cannot be identified and tested by the testers, we will not be able to give marks for the quality assurance of that feature.</span></li>
        <li>The features should fit with the rest of the software (and the target user profile) and should have the consent of the team members. <span class="dimmed">You will lose marks if you go 'rogue' and add features that don't fit with the product.</span></li>
      </ul>

      <p>We strongly recommend that you contribute to multiple (preferably, all) aspects of the project e.g. write backend code, frontend code, test code, user documentation, and developer documentation. If you limit yourself to certain aspects only, you will lose marks allocated for the aspects you did not do.</p>
      <p>In particular, <mark>you are required to divide work based on features rather than components</mark>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>By the <tooltip content="i.e. by `v1.4`">end of this project</tooltip> each team member is expected to have implemented at least one feature end-to-end, doing required changes in <em>almost all</em> components. <span class="dimmed">Â Reason: to encourage you to learn all components of the software, instead of limiting yourself to just one/few components</span>.</li>
        <li>Nevertheless, you are <mark>still expected to divide the components of the product among team members</mark> so that each team member is <em>in charge</em> of one or more components. While others will be modifying those components as necessary for the features they are implementing, your role as the <em>in charge</em> of a component is to guide others modifying that component <span class="dimmed">(reason: you are supposed to be the most knowledgeable about that component)</span> and protect that component from degrading <span class="dimmed">Â e.g., you can review others' changes to your component and suggest possible changes</span>.</li>

        <p>Here are some examples from the past project (Enhancing an AddressBook application) of different enhancements and the grade the student is likely to earn for the relevant parts of the project grade.</p>
        <p>While these examples do not necessarily translate directly to the current project, they should give you an idea of the depth of the feature and the effort required to implement it (including automated tests and documentation).</p>

        <li>Based on past experience, <mark>it is possible for a feature consisting of <strong>~300-500 LoC of functional code</strong> and <strong>~200-400 LoC of test code</strong> to earn full marks</mark> provided the feature does well in all grading criteria.</li>
        <li><strong>Note:</strong> <mark>The lines of code count mentioned above is counted after Phase 1 of the project</mark></li>
      </ul>
      <h5 id="individual-expectations-on-documentation">[Individual] Expectations on Documentation</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>You are expected to write user documentation and developer documentation for your features.</li>
        <li><strong>The objective is to showcase your ability to write the two types of documentation.</strong> If the documentation for your features is not enough to meet that objective, or does not reach the following <em>minimal requirement</em>, you can make up the shortfall by documenting 'proposed' features and alternative designs/implementations.
          <ul>
            <li>Contribution to the <strong>user guide: 1 page</strong></li>
            <li>Contribution to the <strong>developer guide: 3 pages</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You are expected to <mark>showcase your ability to use the various UML diagrams (at least 2 types)</mark>. As mentioned in the previous point, if the documentation of your features doesn't give you enough opportunities to do so <span class="dimmed">e.g., your features only required minor updates to existing diagrams</span>, you are expected to create those opportunities yourself by documenting proposed features or alternative designs. Evaluators will not be able to give you marks unless there is sufficient evidence of your documentation skills.</li>

      <div id="testing-expectations">
        <ul>
          <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
          <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests. (Please refer to <em>Expectations on Lines of Code</em> for LoC requirement).</li>
          <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
