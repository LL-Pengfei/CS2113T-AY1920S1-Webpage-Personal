* There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.
* You ==must write _some_ tests== so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.
* How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.
* Applying <tooltip content="Test-Driven Development">TDD</tooltip> is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional code because the code has low testability.

**Preparation**:
* Ensure you have access to a **computer that is able to run module projects** %%&nbsp;e.g. has the right Java version%%.
* **Have a good screen grab tool** with annotation features so that you can quickly take a screenshot of a bug, annotate it, and post in the issue tracker.
* :bulb: You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to paste a picture from the clipboard into a text box in GitHub issue tracker.
