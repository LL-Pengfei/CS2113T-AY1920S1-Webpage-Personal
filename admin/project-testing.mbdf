**Preparation**:

* Ensure that **you can access the relevant issue tracker** given below:<br>
  -- for PE Dry Run (at **v1.3**): [nus-{{ module | lower }}-{{ semester }}/**pe-dry-run**]({{module_org}}/pe-dry-run/issues)<br>
  -- for PE (at **v1.4**): [nus-{{ module | lower }}-{{ semester }}/**pe**]({{module_org}}/pe/issues) (will open only near the actual PE)
  * ==These are private repos!==. If you cannot access the relevant repo, you may not have accepted the invitation to join the GitHub org used by the module. Go to [https://github.com/orgs/nus-{{ module | lower }}-{{ semester }}/invitation](https://github.com/orgs/nus-{{ module | lower }}-{{ semester }}/invitation) to accept the invitation.
  * If you cannot find the invitation, post in our [forum]({{ forum_link }}).

* Ensure you have access to a **computer that is able to run module projects** %%&nbsp;e.g. has the right Java version%%.

* **Have a good screen grab tool** with annotation features so that you can quickly take a screenshot of a bug, annotate it, and post in the issue tracker.
  * :bulb: You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to paste a picture from the clipboard into a text box in GitHub issue tracker.

* **Charge your computer** before coming to the PE session. The testing venue may not have enough charging points.
