To expedite your project implementation, you will be given some sample code (AddressBook-Level1 to AddressBook-Level4, shown as `AB1` to `AB4` in the diagram above).  You can use `AB1` to `AB3` to ramp up your tech skills in preparation for the project. `AB4` is the version you will use as the starting point for your final project. Some of the work you do in `AB1` to `AB3` can be ported over to `AB4` and can be used to claim credit in the final project.

Given below is the high-level timeline of the project.

Week  | Stage     | Activities
------|-----------|-----------
**3** |inception| <span id="inception-overview">Decide on a overall project direction %%(user profile, problem addressed, optimize or morph?).%%</span>
