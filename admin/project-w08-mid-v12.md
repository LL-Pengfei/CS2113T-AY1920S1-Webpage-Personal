**<big>Project Management:</big>**

<box>

:bulb: **You are free to adjust _process rigor_ and _project plan_ at any future time in the project**, starting from v1.2. If you are not sure if a certain adjustment is allowed, you can check with the teaching team first.
</box>

* **Switch to AB-3 or AB-2 if AB-4 is not working out for you**.

* **Adjust process rigor to suit your team's pace**, as explained in the panel below.

* **Adjust project plan if necessary**. Now that you have a some idea about the code base, revisit the feature release plan and adjust it if necessary.

* **Set up the issue tracker** as described in the panel below, if you haven't done so already.

* **Start proper schedule tracking and milestone management** as explained in the panel below.

 If an enhancement is too big to complete in one milestone, try to deliver it in smaller incremental steps e.g. deliver a basic version of the enhancement first.
