            <h2 id="project-schedule-tracking">Project Schedule Tracking</h2>
            <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the current status of the project. You can also use GitHub's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
            <h3 id="using-issues">Using Issues:</h3>
            <p><big><strong>During the initial stages</strong></big> (latest by the start of v1.2):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong>
                  <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span> <code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br>
                  <code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Formalize the project plan</strong> by assigning relevant issues to the corresponding milestone.</p>

            </ul>
            <p><big><strong>From milestone v1.2:</strong></big></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Define project tasks as issues</strong>. When you start implementing a user story (or a feature), break it down to smaller tasks if necessary. Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. <mark>Create issues for each</mark> of those tasks so that they can be tracked.<span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
                <ul>

                    <p>A typical task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours.</p>

                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks. Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign aÂ single personÂ to doÂ within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><span class="dimmed"><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-down"></span></span> Bad:<code>Implementing parser</code>Â (reason: too big).</span></li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Do not track things taken for granted. <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Write a descriptive title for the issue. <span class="dimmed">e.g. <code>Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser</code></span></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Omit redundant details. In some cases, the issue title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the issue description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal description is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.<br><br></li>

              <p>We recommend you do proper milestone management starting from v1.2. <mark>Given below are the conditions to satisfy for a milestone to be considered properly managed</mark>:</p>
              <p><strong>Planning a Milestone</strong>:<br></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Issues assigned to the milestone, team members assigned to issues</strong>: Used <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-milestones/">GitHub milestones</a> to indicate which issues are to be handled for which milestone by assigning issues to suitable milestones. Also make sure those issues are assigned to team members. <span class="dimmed">Note that you can change the milestone plan along the way as necessary.</span></p>

                  <p><strong>Deadline set for the milestones</strong> (in the GitHub milestone). <span class="dimmed">Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</span></p>

                  <p><strong>A working product tagged</strong> with the correct tag (e.g. <code>v1.2</code>) and is pushed to the main repo<br>
                    or a <strong>product <em>release</em> done on GitHub</strong>. A product release is optional for v1.2 but required from from v1.3. Click <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/releases/">here</a> to see an example release.</p>
                </li>

                  <p><strong>All tests passing</strong> on Travis for the version tagged/released.</p>

                <li>
                  <p><strong>Milestone updated to match the product</strong> i.e. all issues completed and PRs merged for the milestone should be assigned to the milestone. Incomplete issues/PRs should be moved to a future milestone.<br>
