          <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the
            current status of the project. You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
          <h3 id="using-issues">Using Issues:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong>
                <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span> <code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br>
                <code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks.</strong> Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="dimmed">üëç Good:¬†Update class diagram in the project manual for v1.4</span></li>
                <li><span class="dimmed">üëé Bad¬†(reasons: not a one-person task, not small enough):¬†Write the project manual</span></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Write a descriptive title for the issue.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g. Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks.</strong> Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a¬†single person¬†to do¬†within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>
              <ul>
                <li><code>Implementing parser</code>¬† <span class="dimmed">: too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week.</span></li>
                <li><code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code>¬†<span class="dimmed">: appropriate size.</span></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Do not track things taken for granted.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Omit redundant details.</strong> In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal
                description is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assign tasks to team members using the <code>assignees</code> field.</strong> At any point, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Optionally, you can use <code>status.ongoing</code> label to indicate issues currently ongoing.</strong></p>

              <li>
                <p>Set the deadlines for milestones (in GitHub). Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>A working product tagged with the correct tag (e.g. v1.2) is pushed to the main repo.</p>

              <li>
                <p>All tests passing on Travis for the version tagged above.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Milestone updated to match the product i.e. all issues completed and PRs merged for the milestone should be assigned to the milestone.<br>

                <p>Milestone closed. If there are incomplete issues or unmerged PRs in the milestone, move them to a future milestone.<br>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Optionally, issues for the next milestone are assigned to team members (this is not compulsory to do <em>before</em> the tutorial, but we recommend you to do it soon after the tutorial).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Optionally, future milestones are revised based on what you experienced in the current milestone <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. if you could not finish all issues assigned to the current milestone, it is a sign that you overestimated how much you can do in a week, which means you might want to reduce the issues assigned to future milestones to match that observation</span>.</p>

              <li>

        <p>üí° We use a tool called <em>Collate</em> to extract out code written by each member in your final project submission. The tool requires you to annotate code with special tags to mark code written by you. Adding those annotations is usually done
          at v1.3 but you are welcome to start early.</p>
        <panel header="**How to collate code for grading**" no-close="">
          <div>Collate is a tool for collating code written by different developers.
            <p>Steps to use Collate:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a></li>
              <li>Annotate your code to indicate who wrote which part of the code (instructions given below)</li>
              <li>Run the Collate tool to collate code written by each person into separate files (instructions given below)</li>
            </ol>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}</code>.

                <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub username) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours can add
                  the GitHub username to the empty tag later. Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>

            <p>Refer to <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate/blob/master/docs/User-Guide.md">Collate Tool's user guide</a> to find how to run the tool over the annotated code.</p>
            <p>Given below are DOS sample commands you can put in a batch file and run it to collate the code.</p>
            <pre class="hljs"><code>java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from src/main to collated/functional include java, fxml, css

java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from src/test to collated/test include java

java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from unused to collated/unused include java, fxml, css
</code></pre>
            <p>The output should be something like the structure given below.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>If a feature has been released in this version, remove the <code>Coming in v2.0</code> annotation from that feature. Also replace UI mock-ups with actual screenshots.</li>
            <li>If a feature design has changed, update the descriptions accordingly.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><mark>Each member should describe the implementation of at least one enhancement she has added</mark> (or planning to add). <br> Expected length: 1+ page per person</li>
            <li>The description can contain things such as,
              <ul>
                <li>How the feature is implemented.</li>
                <li>Why it is implemented that way.</li>
                <li>Alternatives considered.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The stated objective is to explain the implementation to a future developer, but a hidden objective is to show evidence that you can document deeply-technical content using prose, examples, diagrams, code snippets, etc. appropriately. To that
              end, you may also describe features that you plan to implement in the future, even beyond v1.4 (hypothetically).</li>
            <li>For an example, see <a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s2.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html#undo-redo-feature">the description of the undo/redo feature implementation in the AddressBook-Level4 developer guide</a>.</li>

      <h3 id="v12-demo">v1.2 Demo</h3>
      <p>Do an informal demo of the new feature during the tutorial. <mark>Each team member should demo their own work, using commit tagged as <code>v1.2</code> in the <code>master</code> branch</mark> <span class="dimmed">¬†i.e. only features included in the current release should be demoed</span>.</p>
