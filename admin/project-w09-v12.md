### v1.2 Project Management

* {{ icon_team }} Manage the milestone v1.2 as explained in <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v12-projectTracking">[Admin {{ icon_embedding }} Appendix E: GitHub: Project Schedule Tracking]</trigger>.

### v1.2 Product

* {{ icon_individual }} Merge some code into the `master` branch of your team repo. ==This is expected to be a user-visible enhancement.==

### v1.2 Documentation

* **User Guide**: Update as necessary.
  * If a feature has been released in this version, remove the `Coming in v2.0` annotation from that feature. Also replace UI mock-ups with actual screenshots.
  * If a feature design has changed, update the descriptions accordingly.

* **Developer Guide**:
  * ==Each member should describe the implementation of at least one enhancement she has added== (or planning to add). <br>
    Expected length: 1+ page per person
  * The description can contain things such as,
    * How the feature is implemented.
    * Why it is implemented that way.
    * Alternatives considered.
  * The stated objective is to explain the implementation to a future developer, but a hidden objective is to show evidence that you can document deeply-technical content using prose, examples, diagrams, code snippets, etc. appropriately. To that end, you may also describe features that you plan to implement in the future, even beyond v1.4 (hypothetically).
  * For an example, see [the description of the undo/redo feature implementation in the AddressBook-Level4 developer guide](https://nus-{{ module | lower }}-{{ semester | lower }}.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html#undo-redo-feature).
  

### v1.2 Demo

Do an informal demo of the new feature during the tutorial. ==To save time, we recommend that one member demos all new features, using the commit tagged as `v1.2` in the `master` branch== %%&nbsp;i.e. only features included in the current release should be demoed%%.
