        <li>üí° We recommend that <strong>each PR also updates the relevant parts of documents and tests</strong>. That way, your documentation/testing work will not pile up towards the end.</li>

            <p>In previous semesters we asked students to annotate all their code using special <code>@@author</code> tags so that we can extract each student's code for grading. This semester, we are trying out a tool called RepoSense that is expected to <strong>reduce the need for such tagging</strong>, and also make it <strong>easier for you to see (and learn from) code written by others</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>1. View the current status of code authorship data:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>The report generated by the tool is available at <a href="https://nuscs2113-ay1920s1.github.io/cs2113-dashboard">Project Code Dashboard</a>.</strong> The feature that is most relevant to you is the <em>Code Panel</em> (shown on the right side of the screenshot above). It shows the code attributed to a given author. You are welcome to play around with the <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md#interpreting-the-report">other features</a> (they are still under development and will not be used for grading this semester).</li>
              <li>Click on your name to load the code attributed to you (based on Git blame/log data) onto the code panel on the right.</li>
              <li>If the code shown roughly matches the code you wrote, all is fine and there is nothing for you to do.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. If the code does not match:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Here are the possible reasons for the code shown not to match the code you wrote:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the git username in some of your commits does not match your GitHub username (perhaps you missed our instructions to set your Git username to match GitHub username earlier in the project, or GitHub did not honor your Git username for some reason)</li>
                  <li>the actual authorship does not match the authorship determined by git blame/log e.g., another student touched your code after you wrote it, and Git log attributed the code to that student instead</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>In those cases,</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Install RepoSense (see the <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md#getting-started">Getting Started</a> section of the RepoSense User Guide)</li>
                  <li>Use the two methods described in the RepoSense User Guide section <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md#configuring-a-repo-to-provide-additional-data-to-reposense">Configuring a Repo to Provide Additional Data to RepoSense</a> to provide additional data to the authorship analysis to make it more accurate.</li>
                  <li>If you add a <code>config.json</code> file to your repo (as specified by one of the two methods),
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Please use the <a href="/website/admin/reposenseConfigTemplates.html">template json file given in the module website</a></strong> so that your display name matches the name we expect it to be.</li>
                      <li>If your commits have multiple author names, specify all of them e.g., <code>&quot;authorNames&quot;: [&quot;theMyth&quot;, &quot;theLegend&quot;, &quot;theGary&quot;]</code></li>
                      <li>Update the line <code>config.json</code> in the <code>.gitignore</code> file of your repo as <code>/config.json</code> so that it ignores the <code>config.json</code> produced by the app but not the <code>_reposense/config.json</code>.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>If you add <code>@@author</code> annotations, please follow the guidelines below:</li>
                </ul>

                        <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>.<br>
                          The <code>//@@author</code> tag should indicates the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code> tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author.
                          Here is a sample code file:</p>
                        <pre><code class="hljs">//@@author johndoe

method 2 ...
//@@author sarahkhoo

                        <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub username) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours can add the GitHub username to the empty tag later.
                          Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>
                        <pre><code class="hljs">method 0 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author

                        <p><strong>The author tag syntax varies based on file type</strong> e.g. for java, css, fxml. Use the corresponding comment syntax for non-Java files.<br>
                          Here is an example code from an xml/fxml file.</p>

                          <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to annotate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
                          <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
                          <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>

In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant tests. Even repetitive code blocks within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.
                          Individual members are responsible for making sure code attributed to them are correct.
                          If you notice a team member claiming credit for code that he/she did not write or use other questionable tactics, you can email us (after the final submission) to let us know.</p>
