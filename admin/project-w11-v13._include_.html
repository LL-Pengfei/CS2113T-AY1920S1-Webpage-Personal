        <div>Collate is a tool for collating code written by different developers.
          <p>Steps to use Collate:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a></li>
            <li>Annotate your code to indicate who wrote which part of the code (instructions given below)</li>
            <li>Run the Collate tool to collate code written by each person into separate files (instructions given below)</li>
          </ol>
          <h4 id="annotating-code-to-indicate-authorship">Annotating code to indicate authorship</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>.<br> The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code>                tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author. Here is a sample code file:</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author sarahkhoo
method 3 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub username) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours can add the
                GitHub username to the empty tag later. Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>method 0 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author
method 3 ...
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>The author tag syntax varies based on file type</strong> e.g. for java, css, fxml. Use the corresponding comment syntax for non-Java files.<br> Here is an example code from an xml file.</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;!-- @@author sereneWong --&gt;
&lt;textbox&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;...&lt;/label&gt;

            <li>
              <p><strong>Do not put the <code>//@@author</code> inside java header comments</strong> as only the content below that tag will be collated.<br> üëé

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Annotate both functional and test code but not documentation files.</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Annotate only significant size code blocks that can be reviewed on its own</strong> <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g., a class, a sequence of methods, a  method.</span> <br> <strong>Claiming credit for code blocks smaller than a method is discouraged</strong>                but allowed. If you do, do it sparingly and only claim meaningful blocks of code such as a block of statements, a loop, or an if-else statement%%.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to collate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
                <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
                <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>
                <li>üí° GitHub has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/"><em>blame</em> feature and a <em>history</em></a> feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Do not try to boost the length of your collated files using dubious means</strong> such as duplicating the same code in multiple places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant tests. Even repetitive code
                blocks within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.<br> Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated files contain the correct content.<br> If you notice a team member
                claiming credit for code that he/she did not write or use other questionable tactics, you can email us (after the final submission) to let us know.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final product</strong>,</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Create a folder called <code>{project root}/unused</code></li>
                <li>Move unused files (or copies of files containing unused code) to that folder</li>
                <li>use <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}-unused</code> to mark unused code in those files (note the suffix <code>unused</code>) e.g.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe-unused

              <p><strong>If you reused code from elsewhere,</strong> mark such code as <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}-reused</code> (note the suffix <code>reused</code>) e.g.

                      is to provide you more flexibility to show your documentation skills. <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. you can bring in a proposed feature just to give you an opportunity to use a UML diagram type not used by the actual features.</span></li>
                    <li>other significant contributions to the project <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. tweaks to existing features, setting up project tools</span></li>
                  </ul>

                <li>Other things you can include:

                    <li>Evidence of helping others <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. responses you posted in our forum, bugs you reported in other team's products</span>,</li>
                    <li>Evidence of technical leadership <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. offering features for others to reuse, evidence of those features being reused by others</span></li>

                <li>Page limit: If you have more content than the limit given below, shorten (or omit some content) so that you do not exceed the page limit.

                  The actual amount of content you require is actually less than what these numbers suggest because the HTML ‚Üí PDF conversion adds a lot of spacing around content.

        <li>You can post in the issue thread to communicate with the tester <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. to ask for more info</span>, etc. However, the tester is not obliged to respond.
          <ul>
            <li>üí° Do not argue with the issue reporter to try to convince that person that your way is correct/better. If at all, you can gently explain the rationale for the current behavior but do not waste time getting involved in long arguments. If you
