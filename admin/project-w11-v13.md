{{ icon_team }} v1.3 jar file released on GitHub | as stated
{{ icon_team }} v1.3 milestone properly wrapped up on GitHub | as stated

### v1.3 Project Management

Ensure your code is RepoSense-compatible, <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v13-reposense">as explained in mid-v1.3</trigger>.

<modal large title="Admin {{ icon_embedding }} Project → v1.3 (extract)" id="modal:v13-reposense">
  <include src="reposenseCompatibility.md" />
</modal>

### v1.3 Product

* As before, move the product towards v2.0.

* {{ icon_important_big_red }} **Do a <tooltip content="resulting in a jar file on GitHub that can be downloaded by potential users">proper product release</tooltip>** [as described in the Developer Guide](https://nus-{{ module | lower }}-{{ semester }}.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html#making-a-release). Do some manual tests to ensure the jar file works.

### v1.3 Documentation

<tip-box>

{{ icon_important_big_red }} v1.3 user guide should be updated to match the current version of the product. %%&nbsp;Reason: v1.3 will be subjected to a trial _acceptance testing_ session%%

</tip-box>

* **README page**: Update to look like a real product (rather than a project for learning SE) if you haven't done so already. In particular, ==update the `Ui.png` to match the current product (<trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v13-tipsForProductScreenshot">:bulb: tips</trigger>)==.

<modal large title="Admin → Project Deliverables → Website" id="modal:v13-tipsForProductScreenshot">
  <include src="project-deliverables.md#tips-for-product-screenshot"/>
</modal>
  
* **User Guide**: ==This document will be used by acceptance testers==. Update to match the current version. In particular,
  * Clearly indicate which features are not implemented yet %%e.g. tag those features with a `Coming in v2.0`%%.
  * For those features already implemented, ensure their descriptions match the exact behavior of the product %%e.g. replace mockups with actual screenshots%%
 
* **Developer Guide**: As before, update if necessary.
  
* **AboutUs page**: Update to reflect current state of roles and responsibilities.  

**Submission**: Must be included in the version tagged `v1.3`.


### v1.3 Demo

* Do a quick demo of the main features ==using the jar file==. Objective: demonstrate that the jar file works.
