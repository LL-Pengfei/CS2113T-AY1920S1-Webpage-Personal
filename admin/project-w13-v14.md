* **Deadline** for all v1.4 submissions is Week 13 Monday 23.59 unless stated otherwise.<br>
* Submit to IVLE folder we have set up, not to your project space.<br>
  {{ module | lower }}T students: documents should be submitted to both modules. It's not enough to submit to CS2101 side only.
* {{ icon_important_big_red }} **Penalty for late submission:**<br>
  ==-1 mark for missing the deadline (up to 2 hour of delay).==<br>
  -2 for an _extended delay_ (up to 24 hours late).<br>
  Penalty for delays beyond 24 hours is determined on a case by case basis.
  * Even a one-second delay is considered late, irrespective of the reason.
  * For submissions done via IVLE, the submission time is the timestamp shown by IVLE.
  * When determining the late submission penalty, **we take the latest submission** even if the same exact file was submitted earlier. Do not submit the same file multiple times if you want to avoid unnecessary late submission penalties.
* The whole team is penalized for problems in team submissions. Only the respective student is penalized for problems in individual submissions. 
* {{ icon_important_big_red }} Please **follow submission instructions closely**. ==Any non-compliance will be penalized==. e.g. wrong file name, team member photos not suitable, etc.
* For pdf submissions, ensure the file is usable and hyperlinks in the file are correct. Problems in documents are considered bugs too %%&nbsp;e.g. broken links, outdated diagrams/instructions etc.%%.
* **Do not update the repo during the 14 days after the deadline.** Get our permission first if you need to update the repo during that _freeze_ period. You can continue to evolve your repo after that.
