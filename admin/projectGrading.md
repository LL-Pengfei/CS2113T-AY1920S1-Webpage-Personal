#### {{ icon_team }} Feature fit:
<div style="font-size:20px">

* **`low`(`1`)**: One of these
  * target user is too general %%&nbsp;i.e. wider than AB4%%
  * target user and/or value proposition not clear from the user guide
  * features don't seem to fit together for the most part
* **`medium`(`2`)**: Some features fit together but some don't.
* **`high`(`3`)**: All features fit together but the features are not very high value to the target user.
* **`excellent`(`4`)**: The target user is clearly defined (not too general) and almost all new features are of high-value to the target user. i.e. the product is very attractive to the target user. ==i.e., a product that makes sense==
