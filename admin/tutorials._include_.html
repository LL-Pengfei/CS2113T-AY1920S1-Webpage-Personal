                <p>The question you should always ask yourself is, 'how do I solve this problem if the lecturer/tutors are not around to help me?'</p>

                    <p><strong>Check what is given</strong>: Check if the problem/concept has been discussed in the lectures, textbook, or the list of resources given to you. Yes, it is easier for you to write an email to the tutor/lecturer instead, but that shouldn't be your default behavior. We know that sometimes it is difficult to find stuff in the resources we have provided. But you should try first.</p>

                    <p><strong>Search</strong>: It is very likely the answer already exists somewhere in the cyberspace. Almost every programming-related question has been answered in places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Don't give an opportunity for someone to ask you to <a href="http://www.jibble.org/stfw/">STFW</a>.<br>
                      Pay attention to the error message you encounter. Sometimes it also contains hints as to how to fix the problem. Even if not, a web search on the error message is a good starting point.  <br>

                    <p>Ask classmates using the module forum. Even if you figured out one way to solve a problem, discussing it on a public forum might lead you to better ways of solving it, and will help other classmates who are facing similar problems too. </p>

                      <p><em>Rubber duck debugging</em> is an informal term used in software engineering to refer to a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug his code by forcing himself to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.</p>

                    <p>Here are some tips for posting help request:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>PLEASE search for existing answers before you post your question in those public forums; You don't want to appear as a 'clueless' or 'too lazy to do your research' person in a public forum.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Learn to isolate the problem. &quot;My code doesn't work&quot; isn't going to help even if you post the whole code online. Others don't have time to go through all of your code. Isolate the part that doesn't work and strip it down to the bare minimum that is enough reproduce the error. Sometimes, this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself. If not, at least it increases the chance of someone else being able to help you.</p>
                        <tip-box>
                          <p>💡 How to isolate problematic code? Delete code (one bit at a time) that is confirmed as not related to the problem. Do that until you can still reproduce the problem with the least amount of code remaining.</p>
                        </tip-box>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Generalize the problem. &quot;How to write tasks to a text file using Java&quot; is too specific to what you are working on. You are more likely to find help if you post a thread called (or search for) &quot;How to write to a file using Java&quot;.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Explain well. Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything that is relevant to your problem, your chances of getting an answer in the first try is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they can help you, it will take longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much information into the thread either.</p>
                        <tip-box>

          <li><strong>No ‘teaching’</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from “teaching” concepts that are covered in lectures or other learning resources given to you. Self-learning is a vital part of the module. But of course tutors can help you clarify doubts under the right circumstances.</li>

                    What kind of questions are suitable to discuss with the tutor? Consider these two questions you might want to ask a tutor:
                    <ul>

                        <font color="green"><span><strong><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></span></span> Good</strong></span></font> <em>This is how I understood/applied coupling.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>No leading from the front</strong>: Tutors are not expected to lead your project effort. They will not tell you how to do project tasks or when to do project tasks. You have to figure those out yourselves. But tutors will give you feedback on how you are doing (or have done) project tasks so that you can improve further.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Timing/venue:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Please refer to the <span><a href="/website/index.html">Schedule page</a></span> for further details on each tutorial.</li>
          <li>You are expected to arrive on time. <mark>Punctuality is considered for participation marks.</mark></li>
          <li>You may leave the class 15 minutes before the hour if you have another class right after. There is no need to wait till the tutor dismisses you. However, inform the tutor (as a courtesy) before leaving if you leave before the class is dismissed.</li>
          <li>Please make sure you <mark>vacate the table 5 minutes before the hour</mark> so that the next group can start on time.</li>
          <li>In the past many students have suggested to increase the tutorial duration because 1 hour is barely enough to get through all weekly topics. Increasing the tutorial time is not possible due to lack of venues and tutors. Instead, let's try to make the best of the one hour available by coming well prepared and starting on time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>
        <p>Tutorials are not graded. However, your conduct will be reviewed by team members and the tutor which will determine your participation marks.</p>
