      <p><strong><em>Big-bang integration</em>: integrate all components at the same time.</strong></p>
      <tip-box type="wrong">
        <p>Big-bang is not recommended because it will uncover too many problems at the same time which could make debugging and bug-fixing more complex than when problems are uncovered incrementally.</p>
      </tip-box>
      <p><strong><em>Incremental integration</em>: integrate few components at a time.</strong> This approach is better than the big-bang integration because it surfaces integration problems in a more manageable way.</p>

              <question has-input="true">
                <p>Give two arguments in support and two arguments against the following statement.</p>
                <p><em>Because there is no external client, it is OK to use big bang integration for a school project.</em></p>
                <div slot="answer">
                  <p>Arguments for:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>It is relatively simple; even big-bang can succeed.</li>
                    <li>Project duration is short; there is not enough time to integrate in steps.</li>
                    <li>The system is non-critical, non-production (demo only); the cost of integration issues is relatively small.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Arguments against:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Inexperienced developers; big-bang more likely to fail</li>
                    <li>Too many problems may be discovered too late. Submission deadline (fixed) can be missed.</li>
                    <li>Team members have not worked together before; increases the probability of integration problems.</li>
