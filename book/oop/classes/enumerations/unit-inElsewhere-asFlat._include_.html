      <p><strong>An <em>Enumeration</em> is a fixed set of values that can be considered as a data type.</strong> An enumeration is often useful when using a regular data type such as <code>int</code> or <code>String</code> would allow invalid values to be assigned to a variable. <strong>You are recommended to enumeration types any time you need to represent a fixed set of constants.</strong></p>

        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Suppose you want a variable to store the priority of something. There are only three priority levels: high, medium, and low. You can declare the variable as of type <code>int</code> and use only values <code>2</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>0</code> to indication the three priority levels. However, this opens the possibility of an invalid values such as <code>9</code> to be assigned to it. But if you define an enumeration type called <code>Priority</code> that has three values <code>HIGH</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, <code>LOW</code> only, a variable of type <code>Priority</code> will never be assigned an invalid value because the compiler is able to catch such an error.</p>
        <p><code>Priority</code>: <code>HIGH</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, <code>LOW</code></p>
