      <p><strong>You can use declare a class as abstract when a class is merely a representation of commonalities among its subclasses</strong> in which case it does not make sense to instantiate objects of that class.</p>

        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> The <code>Animal</code> class that exist as a generalization of its subclasses <code>Cat</code>, <code>Dog</code>, <code>Horse</code>, <code>Tiger</code> etc. can be declared as abstract because it does not make sense to instantiate an <code>Animal</code> object.</p>

      <box>
        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> The <code>move</code> method of the <code>Animal</code> class is likely to be an abstract method as it is not possible to implement a <code>move</code> method at the <code>Animal</code> class level to fit all subclasses <span class="dimmed">because each animal type can move in a different way</span>.</p>
      </box>
      <p><strong>A class that has an abstract method becomes an abstract class</strong> because the class definition is incomplete (due to the missing method body) and it is not possible to create objects using an incomplete class definition.</p>
      <p>Even <strong>a class that does not have any abstract methods <em>can</em> be declared as an abstract class.</strong></p>
