        <p>The concept of <strong><em>Objects</em> in OOP is an <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:objectsAsAbstractions-abstraction">abstraction</trigger> mechanism because it allows us to abstract away the lower level details and work with bigger granularity entities</strong> i.e. ignore details of data formats and the method implementation details and work at the level of objects.</p>

              <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is a technique for dealing with complexity. It works by establishing a level of complexity we are interested in, and suppressing the more complex details below that level.</p>
