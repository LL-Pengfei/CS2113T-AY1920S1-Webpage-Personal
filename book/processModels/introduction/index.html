                  <p><strong>Software development goes through different stages such as <em>requirements, analysis, design, implementation</em> and <em>testing</em>. These stages are collectively known as the <em>software development life cycle</em> (SDLC).</strong> There are several approaches, known as <em>software development life cycle models</em> (also called <em>software process models</em>) that describe different ways to go through the SDLC. Each process model prescribes a &quot;roadmap&quot; for the software developers to manage the development effort. The roadmap describes the aims of the development stage(s), the artifacts or outcome of each stage as well as the workflow i.e. the relationship between stages.</p>

                  <p><strong>The <em>sequential model</em>, also called the <em>waterfall</em> model, models software development as a linear process</strong>, in which the project is seen as progressing steadily in one direction through the development stages. The name <em>waterfall</em> stems from how the model is drawn to look like a waterfall (see below).</p>

                  <p><strong>When one stage of the process is completed, it should produce some artifacts to be used in the next stage.</strong> For example, upon completion of the requirement stage a comprehensive list of requirements is produced that will see no further modifications. A strict application of the sequential model would require each stage to be completed before starting the next.</p>
                  <p><strong>This could be a useful model when the problem statement that is well-understood and stable.</strong> In such cases, using the sequential model should result in a timely and systematic development effort, provided that all goes well. As each stage has a well-defined outcome, the progress of the project can be tracked with a relative ease.</p>
                  <p><strong>The major problem with this model is that requirements of a real-world project are rarely well-understood at the beginning and keep changing over time.</strong> One reason for this is that users are generally not aware of how a software application can be used without prior experience in using a similar application.</p>

                  <p><strong>The iterative model (sometimes called <em>iterative</em> and <em>incremental</em>) advocates having several <em>iterations</em> of SDLC.</strong> Each of the iterations could potentially go through all the development stages, from requirement gathering to testing &amp; deployment. Roughly, it appears to be similar to several cycles of the sequential model.</p>
                  <img src="/website/book/processModels/introduction/iterativeModels/images/diagram.png" height="300">
                  <p></p>
                  <p><strong>In this model, each of the iterations produces a new version of the product.</strong> Feedback on the version can then be fed to the next iteration. Taking the Minesweeper game as an example, the iterative model will deliver a fully playable version from the early iterations. However, the first iteration will have primitive functionality, for example, a clumsy text based UI, fixed board size, limited randomization etc. These functionalities will then be improved in later releases.</p>
                  <p><strong>The iterative model can take a <em>breadth-first</em> or a <em>depth-first</em> approach to iteration planning.</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>breadth-first</strong>: an iteration evolves all major components in parallel.</li>
                    <li><strong>depth-first</strong>: an iteration focuses on fleshing out only some components.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Most project use a mixture of breadth-first and depth-first iterations.</strong> Hence, the common phrase ‘an iterative and incremental process’.</p>

                  <p>In 2001, a group of prominent software engineering practitioners met and brainstormed for an alternative to documentation-driven, heavyweight software development processes that were used in most large projects at the time. This resulted in something called the <em>agile manifesto</em> (a vision statement of what they were looking to do).</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.</p>
                    <p>Through this work we have come to value:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</li>
                      <li><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</li>
                      <li><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</li>
                      <li><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.<br>
                      <sub>Extract from the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a></sub></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>Subsequently, some of the signatories of the manifesto went on to create process models that try to follow it. These processes are collectively called agile processes. Some of the key features of agile approaches are:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Requirements are prioritized based on the needs of the user, are clarified regularly (at times almost on a daily basis) with the entire project team, and are factored into the development schedule as appropriate.</li>
                    <li>Instead of doing a very elaborate and detailed design and a project plan for the whole project, the team works based on a rough project plan and a high level design that evolves as the project goes on.</li>
                    <li>Strong emphasis on complete transparency and responsibility sharing among the team members. The team is responsible together for the delivery of the product. Team members are accountable, and regularly and openly share progress with each other and with the user.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>There are a number of agile processes in the development world today. <em>eXtreme Programming (XP)</em> and <em>Scrum</em> are two of the well-known ones.</strong></p>
