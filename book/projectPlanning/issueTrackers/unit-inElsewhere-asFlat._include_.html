        <p>Keeping track of project tasks <span class="dimmed">(who is doing what, which tasks are ongoing, which tasks are done etc.)</span> is an essential part of project management. In small projects it may be possible to track tasks using simple tools as online spreadsheets or general-purpose/light-weight tasks tracking tools such as Trello. Bigger projects need more sophisticated task tracking tools.</p>
        <p><strong>Issue trackers (sometimes called bug trackers) are commonly used to track task assignment and progress.</strong> Most online project management software such as GitHub, SourceForge, and BitBucket come with an integrated issue tracker.</p>
