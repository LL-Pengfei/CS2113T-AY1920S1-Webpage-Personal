      <p><strong>Remote repositories are copies of a repo that are hosted on remote computers.</strong> They are especially useful for sharing the revision history of a codebase among team members of a multi-person project. <span class="dimmed">They can also serve as a remote backup of your code base.</span></p>
      <p><strong>You can <mark><em>clone</em></mark> a remote repo onto your computer</strong> which will create a copy of a remote repo on your computer, including the version history as the remote repo.</p>
      <p><strong>You can <mark><em>push</em></mark> new commits in your clone to the remote repo</strong> which will copy the new commits onto the remote repo. Note that pushing to a remote repo requires you to have write-access to it.</p>
      <p><strong>You can <mark><em>pull</em></mark> from the remote repos to receive new commits in the remote repo</strong>. Pulling is used to <em>sync</em> your local repo with latest changes to the remote repo.</p>
      <p>While it is possible to set up your own remote repo on a server, an easier option is to use a remote repo hosting service such as GitHub or BitBucket.</p>
      <p><strong>A <mark><em>fork</em></mark> is a remote copy of a remote repo</strong>. If there is a remote repo that you want to push to but you do not have write access to it, you can fork the remote repo, which gives you your own remote repo that you can push to.</p>
      <p><strong>A <mark><em>pull request</em></mark> is mechanism for contributing code to a remote repo.</strong> It is a formal request sent to the maintainers of the repo asking them to pull your new code to their repo.</p>
