          <trigger for="pop:rcs">RCS</trigger> tools store the history of the working directory as a series of commits.
        </strong> This means we should commit after each change that we want the RCS to 'remember' for us.</p>
      <p><strong>To see what changed between two points of the history, you can ask the RCS tool to <mark><em>diff</em></mark> the two commits in concern.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>To restore the state of the working directory at a point in the past, you can <mark><em>checkout</em></mark> the commit in concern.</strong> i.e., we can traverse the history of the working directory simply by checking out the commits we are interested in.</p>
