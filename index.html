                            <p><strong>Software projects often involve <em>workflows</em>.</strong> Workflows define the <tooltip content="a connected sequence of steps"></tooltip>flow in which a process or a set of tasks is executed.
                              Understanding such workflows is important for the success of the software project.</p>

                              <p>Some examples in which a certain workflow is relevant to software project:</p>
                              <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> A software that automates the work of an insurance company needs to take into account the workflow of processing an insurance claim.</p>

                            <blockquote>
                              <p><strong>Agile designs are emergent, they’re not defined up front.</strong> Your overall system design will emerge over time, evolving to fulfill new requirements and take advantage of new technologies as appropriate. Although you will often do <strong>some initial architectural modeling at the very beginning</strong> of a project, this will be just enough to get your team going. This approach does not produce a fully documented set of models in place before you may begin coding. <sub>-- adapted from <a href="http://agilemodeling.com/essays/agileDesign.htm">agilemodeling.com</a></sub></p>

                            <p>Given below are three commonly used team structures in software development. Irrespective of the team structure, it is a good practice to assign roles and responsibilities to different team members so that someone is clearly in charge of each aspect of the project. In comparison, the ‘everybody is responsible for everything’ approach can result in more chaos and hence slower progress.</p>
                            <img src="/website/book/teamwork/teamStructures/images/diagram.png" height="150">
                            <p></p>
                            <p><strong>Egoless team</strong></p>
                            <p>In this structure, <strong>every team member is equal in terms of responsibility and accountability</strong>. When any decision is required, consensus must be reached. This team structure is also known as a <em>democratic</em> team structure. This team structure usually finds a good solution to a relatively hard problem as all team members contribute ideas.</p>
                            <p>However, the democratic nature of the team structure bears a higher risk of falling apart due to the absence of an authority figure to manage the team and resolve conflicts.</p>
                            <p><strong>Chief programmer team</strong></p>
                            <p>Frederick Brooks proposed that software engineers learn from the medical surgical team in an operating room. In such a team, there is always a chief surgeon, assisted by experts in other areas. Similarly, in a chief programmer team structure, <strong>there is a single authoritative figure, the chief programmer</strong>. Major decisions, e.g. system architecture, are made solely by him/her and obeyed by all other team members. The chief programmer directs and coordinates the effort of other team members. When necessary, the chief will be assisted by domain specialists e.g. business specialists, database expert, network technology expert, etc. This allows individual group members to concentrate solely on the areas where they have sound knowledge and expertise.</p>
                            <p>The success of such a team structure relies heavily on the chief programmer. Not only must he be a superb technical hand, he also needs good managerial skills. Under a suitably qualified leader, such a team structure is known to produce successful work. .</p>
                            <p><strong>Strict hierarchy team</strong></p>
                            <p>In the opposite extreme of an egoless team, a strict hierarchy team has <strong>a strictly defined organization among the team members</strong>, reminiscent of the military or bureaucratic government. Each team member only works on his assigned tasks and reports to a single “boss”.</p>
                            <p>In a large, resource-intensive, complex project, this could be a good team structure to reduce communication overhead.</p>

                      <p>There is no explicit penalty for switching to a lower level AB. All projects are evaluated based on the same yardstick irrespective of on which AB it is based. As an AB is given to you as a 'free' head-start, a lower level AB gives you a shorter head-start, which means you may have to set up certain things by yourself. Nevertheless, you should switch to AB2/3 if you feel you can learn more from the project that way, as our goal is to maximize learning, not features.<br>
                        If your team wants to stay with AB-4 but you want to switch to a lower level AB, let the us know so that we can work something out for you.</p>

That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part.

                                            <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
                                            <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                                            <ol>
                                              <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                                              <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                                              <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                                              <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                                              <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                                              <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                                              <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>
                                            </ol>

                          <p><strong>Reduce automated tests</strong> have benefits, but they can be a pain to write/maintain; GUI tests are especially hard to maintain because their behavior can sometimes depend on things such as the OS, resolution etc.<br>
                            It is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated tests you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off under the circumstances if tests are slowing you down too much.<br>
                            There is no direct penalty for removing GUI tests. Also note <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:appEworkflow-testingExpectations">our expectation on test code</trigger>.</p>

                          <p><strong>Reduce automated checks</strong>: You can also reduce the rigor of checkstyle checks to expedite PR processing.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong>Switch to a lighter workflow</strong>: While <em>forking workflow</em> is the safest, it is also rather heavy. You an switch to a simpler workflow if the forking workflow is slowing you down. Refer the textbook to find more about alternative workflows: <em>branching workflow</em>, <em>centralized workflow</em>. However, we still recommend that you use PR reviews, at least for PRs affecting others' features.</p>

                      <p><strong>You can also increase the rigor/safety of your workflow</strong> in the following ways:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Use GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/"><em>Protected Branches</em></a> feature to protect your <code>master</code> branch against rogue PRs.</li>

                            <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
                            <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>

                        <p>There is no explicit penalty for switching to a lower level AB. All projects are evaluated based on the same yardstick irrespective of on which AB it is based. As an AB is given to you as a 'free' head-start, a lower level AB gives you a shorter head-start, which means you may have to set up certain things by yourself. Nevertheless, you should switch to AB2/3 if you feel you can learn more from the project that way, as our goal is to maximize learning, not features.<br>
                          If your team wants to stay with AB-4 but you want to switch to a lower level AB, let the us know so that we can work something out for you.</p>

That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part.

                                            It is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated tests you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off under the circumstances if tests are slowing you down too much.<br>
                                            There is no direct penalty for removing GUI tests. Also note <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:appEworkflow-testingExpectations">our expectation on test code</trigger>.</p>

You an switch to a simpler workflow if the forking workflow is slowing you down. Refer the textbook to find more about alternative workflows: <em>branching workflow</em>, <em>centralized workflow</em>. However, we still recommend that you use PR reviews, at least for PRs affecting others' features.</p>

                                              <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
                                              <ol>
                                                <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
                                                <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>
                                                <li>Jean creates a pull request from that branch in her fork to the main repo.</li>
                                                <li>Other members review Jean’s pull request.</li>
                                                <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
                                                <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
                                                <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>
                                              </ol>

                            <p><strong>Reduce automated tests</strong> have benefits, but they can be a pain to write/maintain; GUI tests are especially hard to maintain because their behavior can sometimes depend on things such as the OS, resolution etc.<br>
                              It is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated tests you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off under the circumstances if tests are slowing you down too much.<br>
                              There is no direct penalty for removing GUI tests. Also note <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:appEworkflow-testingExpectations">our expectation on test code</trigger>.</p>

                          <li>
                            <p><strong>Switch to a lighter workflow</strong>: While <em>forking workflow</em> is the safest, it is also rather heavy. You an switch to a simpler workflow if the forking workflow is slowing you down. Refer the textbook to find more about alternative workflows: <em>branching workflow</em>, <em>centralized workflow</em>. However, we still recommend that you use PR reviews, at least for PRs affecting others' features.</p>

                        <ul>
                          <li>Use GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/"><em>Protected Branches</em></a> feature to protect your <code>master</code> branch against rogue PRs.</li>

                              <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the risk of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
                              <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>

You can also use GitHub's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
