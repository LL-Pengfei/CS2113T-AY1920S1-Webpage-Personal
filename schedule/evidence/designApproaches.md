Covered by the project. In particular, when getting started on modifying AB-4, you are recommended to start by doing _local_ changes (i.e., changes local to a component) first and then move to _global_ changes (i.e., changes that touch multiple components). As AB-4 users multi-level design, you should be able to do most of the local changes without having to learn internal details of the other components.
