%%{{ icon_evidence | safe }} Evidence:%%

Do an enhancement to [[AddressBook - Level1]({{module_org}}/addressbook-level1)]  %%e.g. add a new command%%

* The size of the enhancement does not matter.
* Step 1: Fork address [AddressBook - Level1]({{module_org}}/addressbook-level1) to your GitHub account.
* Step 2: Change the code in small steps and commit after each significant change. You may commit to the `master` branch.
  * Try to stay within the procedural (not OOP) style of the code base. %%Reason: in this LO, we try to stretch ourselves to the limits of the procedural approach%%.
  * Update all relevant tests. Ensure all tests pass.
  * [Optional] Update all relevant documentation.
  * [Optional] Try to follow [our coding standard]({{baseUrl}}/admin/programmingLanguages.html#java-coding-standard) in your new code.
* Step 3: push the updated AB1 code to your fork

:bulb: Note that you can reuse the code you write here in your final project, if applicable.

**Submission**: No special submission required. Our scripts will check your fork automatically.

<tip-box type="important">
  This task requires coordination and cooperation among team members. It also requires a few days to complete; we recommend that you start it early in the week rather than just before the tutorial day.
</tip-box>

==This task can earn you 3 participation marks==, 2 mark for the individual component and 1 bonus mark for the team component. You can omit either one of them.

:bulb: When working with existing code, a safe approach is to **change the code in very small steps, each resulting in a verifiable change** without breaking the app. For example, when adding a new `sort` command, the first few steps can be,
1. Teach the app to accept a `sort` command but ignore it.
2. Next, teach the app to direct the `sort` command to an existing command e.g. `sort` command simply invokes the `list` command internally.
3. Add a `SortCommand` class but make it simply a copy of the the existing `ListCommand`. Direct the `sort` command to the new `SortCommand`.
4. ...

:bulb: Note that you can reuse the code you write here in your final project, if applicable.


#### Individual component:

**Requirements**: Do an enhancement to [[AddressBook - Level2]({{module_org}}/addressbook-level2)]  %%e.g. add a new command%%. It can be the same enhancement you did to AddressBook Level1 (at the 1KLoC milestone in week 3). The size of the enhancement does not matter but try to limit to one enhancement (rather than mix many enhancements). In addition,
* update the User Guide
* update existing tests and add new tests if necessary, for both JUnit tests and I/O tests
* follow the coding standard
* follow the OOP style

Optional but encouraged:
* Update the Developer Guide

<include src="project.md#PR_to_AB2" />

#### Team component:

The team component is ==to be done by all members==, including those who didn't do the individual component.

* Review PRs created by team members in the _Individual Component_ above %%i.e. add review comments in the PR created against module repo%%. You can either give suggestions to improve, or ask questions to understand, the code written by the team member. 

* **Requirements**: Try to ensure that each PR reviewed by _at least_ one team member and each team member's PR is reviewed by at least one other team member.  

* **Submission**: Just update PR created in the individual component by adding comments/commits to it.

==[Optional, but recommended]== If you are not comfortable jumping from AB-2 (~2KLoc) straight to AB-4 (~10KLoc), we recommend that you play around with [[AddressBook - Level3]({{module_org}}/addressbook-level3)] for a bit before moving to AB-4. As before, fork, clone, set up project in your Computer, and try to do a small enhancement to AB-3.

How AB-3 differs from AB-2:
* A simple GUI has been added to replace the Text UI.
* No more I/O tests
* A `Logic` class has been added together with a `LogicTest` class.
