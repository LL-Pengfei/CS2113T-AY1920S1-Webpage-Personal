<div id="how">

**Acceptable**: Some commits that show some refactorings (not necessarily the ones in the list above) you have done.

**Suggested**: Do some refactoring to the addressbook-level1 code. Remember to commit after each refactoring. The commit message should mention the refactoring you applied. e.g. `AddressBook.java: extract foo() method`

**Submission**: Show the relevant commits during the tutorial.

</div>

<div id="when">

Give an example from any project (e.g. addressbook-level1) where a refactoring can be applied but you decide against it because it is not worth it.
