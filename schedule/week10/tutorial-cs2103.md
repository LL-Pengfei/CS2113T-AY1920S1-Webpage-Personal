**Questions to discuss during tutorial:**

Whole team: do this question together, using the whiteboard:

<div class="indented">
  <include src="../../book/modeling/modelingStructures/objectOrientedDomainModels/q-courseDomainModel.md" />
</div>
<br>

Divide these questions among team members and get ready to answer them.

**Q1**
1. How does an _OO Domain Model_ differ from a class diagram?
1. What's the relationship between an OODM and a class diagram for a software? %%e.g., exactly the same?, one is a sub-set of the other?%%
1. Which diagram can we use to show ~~class~~object structures in a problem domain?

**Q2**
1. Explain and justify: _testing should be efficient and effective_
1. Explain how _exploratory_ and _scripted_ testing is used in AB4/project
1. Give an example of a _negative_ test case in AB4/project
1. Explain _grey-box_ test case design

**Q3**
1. Explain: _Equivalence Partition_ improve E&E of testing
1. What are the EPs for the parameter `day` of this method
   ```java
   /**
    * Returns true if the three values represent a valid day
    */
   boolean isValidDay(int year, int month, int day){
   
   } 
   ```

**Q4**
1. Explain: _Boundary Value Analysis_ improves E&E of testing
1. What are the boundary values for the parameter `day` in the question above?
1. How can EP and BVA heuristics be used in AB4/project? Hint: See [[AB4 Learning Outcomes: LO-TestCaseDesignHeuristics]({{module_org}}/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/LearningOutcomes.adoc#apply-test-case-design-heuristics-code-lo-testcasedesignheuristics-code)]

**Q5**
1. Whatâ€™s a _design pattern_?
1. When do you use the _Singleton_ pattern, _Facade_ pattern, _Command_ pattern?
1. Which of the three patterns are used in AB4? Hint: See [[AB4 Learning Outcomes: LO-DesignPatterns]({{module_org}}/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/LearningOutcomes.adoc#apply-design-patterns-code-lo-designpatterns-code)]
