**Show evidence of achieving v1.3 team/individual milestone**
* [One member] Show the v1.3 release, the milestone, and collated code on GitHub
* [Each member] Demo your contribution for v1.3 using the jar file 

**Questions to discuss during tutorial:**

==While the tutor is checking team/individual milestones, divide these questions among team members and get ready to answer them==. 

1. How does an _OO Domain Model_ differ from a class diagram?

1. Draw an OODM for the description below, about how modules work in a certain university:

   <tip-box> 

   A module has a name and a code. A module is taken by 10 or more students, and taught by one instructor. A module can have a number tasks which can be assignments or tests. Some assignments are compulsory. When a student attempts a task, a grade and an optional feedback is given.

   </tip-box>

1. Apply heuristics for combining multiple test inputs to the following test cases, assuming all 6 values in the table need to be tested. :white_check_mark: indicates valid values and :exclamation: indicates invalid values. Point out where the heuristics are contradicted and how to improve the test cases.

   <tip-box> 
   
   SUT: `foo(x,y)`
   
   Test case |  x  |  y
   --------- | --- | ---
   TC1 | :white_check_mark: x1-valid | :white_check_mark: y1-valid
   TC2 | :white_check_mark: x2-valid | :exclamation: y2-invalid
   TC3 | :exclamation: x3-invalid | :exclamation: y3-invalid
   
   </tip-box>


1. Distinguish between _sequential_ and _iterative_ processes. Which one are we using in the project?

1. Distinguish between _breadth-first_ and _depth-first_ iterative processes using your project as an example.

1. Describe how _agile process models_ differ from traditional process models.

1. Describe some distinguishing features of Scrum. Relate those features to your project. %%&nbsp;i.e. are they applicable? are you doing something similar?%%
    
1. When do you use _MVC_ pattern? Do we have MVC in AB4?

1. When do you use the _Observer_ pattern? Do we have the Observer pattern in AB4?
