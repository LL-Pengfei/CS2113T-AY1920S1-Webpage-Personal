            <p><strong>Learning Management System</strong>: This module website is the main source of information for the module. In addition, we use LumiNUS for lecture webcasts and for admin matters <span class="dimmed">(e.g., announcements, file submissions, grade book, ...)</span>.</p>
            <p><strong>Collaboration platform</strong>: You are <mark><em>required to</em> use GitHub</mark> as the hosting and collaboration platform of your project (i.e., to hold the Code repository, Issue Tracker, etc.). See <a href="/website/admin/index.html#admin-appendixE-github">Appendix E</a> for more info on how to setup and use GitHub for your project.</p>
            <div id="communication">
              <p><strong>Communication</strong>: Keeping a record of communications among your team can help you, and us, in many ways. We encourage you to do at least some of the project communication in written medium (e.g., GitHub Issue Tracker) to practice how to communicate technical things in written form.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Instead of the LumiNUS forum, we encourage you to <mark>post your questions/suggestions in this <a href="https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1920S1/forum/issues">github/nusCS2113-AY1920S1/forum</a></mark>.</li>
                <li>You can use our slack channel <a href="https://nus-cs2113-ay1920s1.slack.com">https://nus-cs2113-ay1920s1.slack.com</a> for team communications. You need to <mark>join the slack channel</mark> (you'll need to use an email address ending in <code>@nus.edu.sg</code>, <code>@comp.nus.edu.sg</code> or <code>@u.nus.edu</code>) to start using this channel).</li>
                <li>Note that slack is useful for quick chats while issue tracker is useful for longer-running conversations.</li>
                <li>You are encouraged to use channels with a wider audience (i.e., the GitHub issue tracker) for module-related communication as much as possible, rather than private channels such as private slack/FB messages or direct emails. <span class="dimmed">Rationale: more classmates can benefit from the discussions</span>.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p><strong>IDE</strong>: You are recommended to use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellij IDEA</a> for module-related programming work. You may use the community edition (free) or the ultimate edition (free for students). While the use of Intellij is not compulsory, note that module materials are optimized for Intellij. Use other IDEs at your own risk.</p>
            <p><strong>Revision control</strong>: You are <mark><em>required to</em> use Git</mark>. Other revision control software are not allowed.<br>
              The recommended GUI client for Git is <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> (which comes bundled with Git), but you may use any other, or none.</p>
            <p><strong>Analyzing code authorship</strong>: We use a custom-built tool called <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense">RepoSense</a> for extracting code written by each person.</p>

                  <p>In previous semesters we asked students to annotate all their code using special <code>@@author</code> tags so that we can extract each student's code for grading. This semester, we are trying out a tool called RepoSense that is expected to <strong>reduce the need for such tagging</strong>, and also make it <strong>easier for you to see (and learn from) code written by others</strong>.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>The report generated by the tool is available at <a href="https://nuscs2113-ay1920s1.github.io/cs2113-dashboard">Project Code Dashboard</a>.</strong> The feature that is most relevant to you is the <em>Code Panel</em> (shown on the right side of the screenshot above). It shows the code attributed to a given author. You are welcome to play around with the <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md#interpreting-the-report">other features</a> (they are still under development and will not be used for grading this semester).</li>
                    <li>Click on your name to load the code attributed to you (based on Git blame/log data) onto the code panel on the right.</li>
                    <li>If the code shown roughly matches the code you wrote, all is fine and there is nothing for you to do.</li>

                    <li>
                      <p>Here are the possible reasons for the code shown not to match the code you wrote:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>the git username in some of your commits does not match your GitHub username (perhaps you missed our instructions to set your Git username to match GitHub username earlier in the project, or GitHub did not honor your Git username for some reason)</li>
                        <li>the actual authorship does not match the authorship determined by git blame/log e.g., another student touched your code after you wrote it, and Git log attributed the code to that student instead</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>In those cases,</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Install RepoSense (see the <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md#getting-started">Getting Started</a> section of the RepoSense User Guide)</li>
                        <li>Use the two methods described in the RepoSense User Guide section <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md#configuring-a-repo-to-provide-additional-data-to-reposense">Configuring a Repo to Provide Additional Data to RepoSense</a> to provide additional data to the authorship analysis to make it more accurate.</li>
                        <li>If you add a <code>config.json</code> file to your repo (as specified by one of the two methods),
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Please use the <a href="/website/admin/reposenseConfigTemplates.html">template json file given in the module website</a></strong> so that your display name matches the name we expect it to be.</li>
                            <li>If your commits have multiple author names, specify all of them e.g., <code>&quot;authorNames&quot;: [&quot;theMyth&quot;, &quot;theLegend&quot;, &quot;theGary&quot;]</code></li>
                            <li>Update the line <code>config.json</code> in the <code>.gitignore</code> file of your repo as <code>/config.json</code> so that it ignores the <code>config.json</code> produced by the app but not the <code>_reposense/config.json</code>.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>

            <p>This product is meant for users who can type fast, and prefer typing over mouse/voice commands. Therefore, <mark>Command Line Interface (CLI) is the primary mode of input.</mark></p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Recommendation-CLI-First</strong>: As per <em>Constraint-Typing-Preferred</em>, the input to the app needs to be primarily CLI. The GUI can be used to give visual feedback to the user rather than to collect input. While we don't prohibit non-CLI inputs, note that such inputs will reduce the suitability of the product to target users, which will be graded under the <em>product design</em> criterion.<br>
                    Some suggestions:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Give keyboard alternatives to mouse/GUI inputs, if any.</li>
                      <li>Regular typing is usually faster than using key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse actions or key combinations.</li>
                      <li>
                        <tooltip content="typing the full command and hitting ENTER will complete the task">One-shot commands</tooltip> are faster over <tooltip content="prompting the user to input one parameter at a time">multi-step commands</tooltip>. If you provide a multi-step command to help new users, you can also provide a one-shot equivalent for regular/expert users. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: We want the user to be able to accomplish tasks faster using CLI than a GUI; having to enter commands part-by-part will slow down the user.</span>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Recommendation-Security-Features</strong>: It is OK to use security features like login, provided you think through the solution completely
                  <span class="dimmed">e.g., having a login functionality to secure the application, but saving the password in clear text is no good, and can cost you marks in &quot;Quality of feature(s)&quot;</span>.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Recommendation-Minimal-Network</strong>: It is OK to use a reliable public API <span class="dimmed">e.g., Google search</span> but we recommend that you have a fallback mechanism (e.g., able to load data using a data file if the network is down). <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> During the mass peer-testing session the network access can be intermittent due to high load. If your feature cannot be tested due to lack of Internet, that will have to be counted as a major bug, to be fair to those whose app is being tested and bugs found being penalized.</span><br>
                  <mark>If you use NUS data</mark> (e.g., scrape data from an NUS website), please work with <a href="https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/contact-us/">NUS IT</a> directly to get their approval first. Even well-intentioned use of NUS data without approval can get you into serious trouble (has happened before). The teaching team will not be able to get approval for you as the use of NUS data is not a module requirement.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Recommendation-Testability</strong>: Avoid implementing hard-to-test (both for manual testing as well as automated testing) features or features that make your product hard-to-test. <span class="dimmed">Reason: <em>testability</em> is a grading criterion. If you choose to implement such a feature, you will need to spend an extra effort to reach an acceptable level of testability.</span>
                  Here are some examples of features that are hard-to-test:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Features that depend heavily on remote APIs: Those APIs can block your access if they mistake your automated tests as a bot attack. Some remote APIs require setting up accounts, keys, login etc, that will irritate the testers of your product and give a low rating to the testability of your work.</li>
                  <li>Audio-related features: The peer testing of your product is done under exam conditions where it is not appropriate to play audio.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <span id="constraint-cli">
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Recommendation-CLI-First</strong>: As per <em>Constraint-Typing-Preferred</em>, the input to the app needs to be primarily CLI. The GUI can be used to give visual feedback to the user rather than to collect input. While we don't prohibit non-CLI inputs, note that such inputs will reduce the suitability of the product to target users, which will be graded under the <em>product design</em> criterion.<br>
                  Some suggestions:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Give keyboard alternatives to mouse/GUI inputs, if any.</li>
                    <li>Regular typing is usually faster than using key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse actions or key combinations.</li>
                    <li>
                      <tooltip content="typing the full command and hitting ENTER will complete the task">One-shot commands</tooltip> are faster over <tooltip content="prompting the user to input one parameter at a time">multi-step commands</tooltip>. If you provide a multi-step command to help new users, you can also provide a one-shot equivalent for regular/expert users. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: We want the user to be able to accomplish tasks faster using CLI than a GUI; having to enter commands part-by-part will slow down the user.</span>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </span>

            <p>To expedite your project implementation, you will be given some sample code (AddressBook-Level1 to AddressBook-Level4, shown as <code>AB1</code> to <code>AB4</code> in the diagram above). You can use <code>AB1</code> to <code>AB3</code> to ramp up your tech skills in preparation for the project. <code>AB4</code> is the version you will use as the starting point for your final project. Some of the work you do in <code>AB1</code> to <code>AB3</code> can be ported over to <code>AB4</code> and can be used to claim credit in the final project.</p>

              <li>Building a software product that is unique, creative, and shiny is not our priority (although we try to do a bit of that too). <strong>Learning to take pride in, and discovering the joy of, high quality software engineering work is our priority</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Following from that, we evaluate you on not just how much you've done, but also, how well you've done those things. Here are some of the aspects in which we focus on:</p>

            <p>In this module, last minute heroics will not earn you a good project grade, and last minute mugging will not earn you a good exam grade.</p>

            <p>When you start the module, some others in the class may appear to know a lot more than you. Don't let that worry you.
