                  <li><strong>The report generated by the tool is available at <a href="https://nuscs2113-ay1920s1.github.io/cs2113-dashboard">Project Code Dashboard</a>.</strong> The feature that is most relevant to you is the <em>Code Panel</em> (shown on the right side of the screenshot above). It shows the code attributed to a given author. You are welcome to play around with the <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md#interpreting-the-report">other features</a> (they are still under development and will not be used for grading this semester).</li>
                  <li>Click on your name to load the code attributed to you (based on Git blame/log data) onto the code panel on the right.</li>
                  <li>If the code shown roughly matches the code you wrote, all is fine and there is nothing for you to do.</li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Here are the possible reasons for the code shown not to match the code you wrote:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>the git username in some of your commits does not match your GitHub username (perhaps you missed our instructions to set your Git username to match GitHub username earlier in the project, or GitHub did not honor your Git username for some reason)</li>
                      <li>the actual authorship does not match the authorship determined by git blame/log e.g., another student touched your code after you wrote it, and Git log attributed the code to that student instead</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>In those cases,</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Install RepoSense (see the <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md#getting-started">Getting Started</a> section of the RepoSense User Guide)</li>
                      <li>Use the two methods described in the RepoSense User Guide section <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md#configuring-a-repo-to-provide-additional-data-to-reposense">Configuring a Repo to Provide Additional Data to RepoSense</a> to provide additional data to the authorship analysis to make it more accurate.</li>
                      <li>If you add a <code>config.json</code> file to your repo (as specified by one of the two methods),
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Please use the <a href="/website/admin/reposenseConfigTemplates.html">template json file given in the module website</a></strong> so that your display name matches the name we expect it to be.</li>
                          <li>If your commits have multiple author names, specify all of them e.g., <code>&quot;authorNames&quot;: [&quot;theMyth&quot;, &quot;theLegend&quot;, &quot;theGary&quot;]</code></li>
                          <li>Update the line <code>config.json</code> in the <code>.gitignore</code> file of your repo as <code>/config.json</code> so that it ignores the <code>config.json</code> produced by the app but not the <code>_reposense/config.json</code>.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>

                            The <code>//@@author</code> tag should indicates the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code> tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author.
                            Here is a sample code file:</p>

The author of code below yours can add the GitHub username to the empty tag later.
                            Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>
                          <pre><code class="hljs">method 0 ...

                            <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to annotate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
                            <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
                            <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>

                            Individual members are responsible for making sure code attributed to them are correct.

            <p>This product is meant for users who can type fast, and prefer typing over mouse/voice commands. Therefore, <mark>Command Line Interface (CLI) is the primary mode of interaction.</mark></p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Recommendation-CLI-First</strong>: As per <em>Constraint-Typing-Preferred</em>, the input to the app needs to be primarily commands based (i.e., the app should be a CLI app). A GUI can be implemented and used to give visual feedback to the user rather than to collect input. While we don't prohibit non-CLI inputs, note that such inputs will reduce the suitability of the product to target users, which will be graded under the <em>product design</em> criterion.<br>
                    Some suggestions:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Give keyboard alternatives to mouse/GUI inputs, if any.</li>
                      <li>Regular typing is usually faster than using key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse actions or key combinations.</li>
                      <li>
                        <tooltip content="typing the full command and hitting ENTER will complete the task">One-shot commands</tooltip> are faster over <tooltip content="prompting the user to input one parameter at a time">multi-step commands</tooltip>. If you provide a multi-step command to help new users, you also need to provide a one-shot equivalent for regular/expert users. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: We want the user to be able to accomplish tasks faster using CLI than a GUI; having to enter commands part-by-part will slow down the user.</span>

              However, you need to ensure that the overall product is cohesive in nature, which means, as a team, you need to decide on a few things before embarking on developing the enhancements. <br>
              The following sections may help you decide on the enhancements.</p>
            <h3 id="project-direction">Project Direction<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-direction"></a></h3>

            <p><strong>Your project should comply with the following constraints.</strong>
              <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason</strong>: to increase comparability among projects and to maximize applicability of module learning outcomes in the project.</span></p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Constraint-Typing-Preferred</strong>: The product should be targeting users who can type fast and prefer typing over other means of input.<br>
                  <span class="dimmed">Reason: to increase comparability of products, and to make feature evaluation easier for peer evaluators.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Constraint-Single-User</strong>: The product should be for a single user i.e. not a multi-user product.<br>
                  <span class="dimmed">Reason: multi-user systems are hard to test, which is unfair for peer testers as the number of bugs they find forms a component of the grade they obtain. Furthermore, the <em>Constraint-Typing-Preferred</em> is unlikely to fit a multi-user product</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Constraint-Incremental</strong>: The product needs to be developed incrementally over the project duration. While it is fine to do less in some weeks and more in other weeks, a reasonably consistent delivery rate is expected. For example, it is not acceptable to do the entire project over the recess week and do almost nothing for the remainder of the semester. <span class="dimmed">Reasons: 1. To simulate a real project where you have to work on a code base over a long period, possibly with breaks in the middle. 2. To learn how to deliver big features in small increments.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Constraint-Human-Editable-File</strong>: The data should be stored locally and should be in a human editable text file.<br>
                  <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> To allow advanced users to manipulate the data by editing the data file.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Constraint-No-DBMS</strong>: Do not use a <tooltip content="Database Management System e.g., MySQL">DBMS</tooltip> to store data.<br>
                  <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> Using a DBMS to store data will reduce the room to apply OOP techniques to manage data. It is true that most real world systems use a DBMS, but given the small size of this project, we need to optimize it for CS2113/T module learning outcomes; covering DBMS-related topics will have to be left to database modules or level 3 project modules.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Constraint-OO</strong>: The software should follow the Object-oriented paradigm.<br>
                  <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> For you to practice using OOP in a non-trivial project.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Constraint-Platform-Independent</strong>: The software should work on the Windows, Linux, and OS-X platforms. Even if you are unable to manually test the app on all three platforms, consciously avoid using OS-dependent libraries and OS-specific features.<br>
                  <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> Peer testers should be able to use any of these platforms.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Constraint-Portable</strong>: The software should work without requiring an installer.
                  <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> We do not want to install all your projects on our testing machines when we test them for grading.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Constraint-No-Remote-Server</strong>: The software should not depend on your own remote server. <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> Anyone should be able to use/test your app any time, even after the semester is over.</span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Constraint-External-Software</strong>: The use of third-party frameworks/libraries is allowed but only if they,</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>are free, open-source, and have permissive license terms <span class="dimmed">(E.g., trial version of libraries that require purchase after N days are not allowed)</span>.</li>
                  <li>do not require any installation by the user of your software.</li>
                  <li>do not violate other constraints.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>and is subjected to prior approval by the teaching team.<br>
                  <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> We will not allow third-party software that can interfere with the learning objectives of the module.</span></p>
                <p>Please <mark>post in the <a href="https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1920S1/forum/issues">forum</a> your request to use a third-party libraries</mark> <em>before</em> you start using the library. Once a specific library has been approved for one team, other teams may use it without requesting permission again.<br>
                  <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> The whole class should know which external software are used by others so that they can do the same if they wish to.</span></p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>In addition, you are strongly encouraged to follow these recommendations</strong> as they can help increase your project score.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Recommendation-Security-Features</strong>: It is OK to use security features like login, provided you think through the solution completely
                  <span class="dimmed">e.g., having a login functionality to secure the application, but saving the password in clear text is no good, and can cost you marks in &quot;Quality of feature(s)&quot;</span>.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Recommendation-Minimal-Network</strong>: It is OK to use a reliable public API <span class="dimmed">e.g., Google search</span> but we recommend that you have a fallback mechanism (e.g., able to load data using a data file if the network is down). <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason:</strong> During the mass peer-testing session the network access can be intermittent due to high load. If your feature cannot be tested due to lack of Internet, that will have to be counted as a major bug, to be fair to those whose app is being tested and bugs found being penalized.</span><br></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Recommendation-NUS-data</strong>: If you use NUS data (e.g., scrape data from an NUS website), please work with <a href="https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/contact-us/">NUS IT</a> directly to get their approval first. Even well-intentioned use of NUS data without approval can get you into serious trouble (has happened before). <mark><em>The teaching team will not be able to get approval for you as the use of NUS data is not a module requirement</em></mark>.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Recommendation-Testability</strong>: Avoid implementing hard-to-test (both for manual testing as well as automated testing) features or features that make your product hard-to-test. <span class="dimmed">Reason: <em>testability</em> is a grading criterion. If you choose to implement such a feature, you will need to spend an extra effort to reach an acceptable level of testability.</span>
                  Here are some examples of features that are hard-to-test:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Features that depend heavily on remote APIs: Those APIs can block your access if they mistake your automated tests as a bot attack. Some remote APIs require setting up accounts, keys, login etc, that will irritate the testers of your product and give a low rating to the testability of your work.</li>
                  <li>Audio-related features: The peer testing of your product is done under exam conditions where it is not appropriate to play audio.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <span id="constraint-cli">
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Recommendation-CLI-First</strong>: As per <em>Constraint-Typing-Preferred</em>, the input to the app needs to be primarily commands based (i.e., the app should be a CLI app). A GUI can be implemented and used to give visual feedback to the user rather than to collect input. While we don't prohibit non-CLI inputs, note that such inputs will reduce the suitability of the product to target users, which will be graded under the <em>product design</em> criterion.<br>
                  Some suggestions:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Give keyboard alternatives to mouse/GUI inputs, if any.</li>
                    <li>Regular typing is usually faster than using key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse actions or key combinations.</li>
                    <li>
                      <tooltip content="typing the full command and hitting ENTER will complete the task">One-shot commands</tooltip> are faster over <tooltip content="prompting the user to input one parameter at a time">multi-step commands</tooltip>. If you provide a multi-step command to help new users, you also need to provide a one-shot equivalent for regular/expert users. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: We want the user to be able to accomplish tasks faster using CLI than a GUI; having to enter commands part-by-part will slow down the user.</span>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </span>



            <box type="warning">

              The product is you, NOT what you build.
            </tip-box>
            <p>The software product you build is a side effect only. You are the product of this module. This means,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>We may not take the most efficient route to building the software product. <strong>We take the route that allows you to learn the most</strong>.</li>
              <li>Building a software product that is unique, creative, and shiny is not our priority (although we try to do a bit of that too). <strong>Learning to take pride in, and discovering the joy of, high quality software engineering work is our priority</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Following from that, we evaluate you on not just how much you've done, but also, how well you've done those things. Here are some of the aspects in which we focus on:</p>

            <p>In this module, last minute heroics will not earn you a good project grade, and last minute mugging will not earn you a good exam grade.</p>

            <p>When you start the module, some others in the class may appear to know a lot more than you. Don't let that worry you.
