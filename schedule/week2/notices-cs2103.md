* Note that **module announcements will be posted in in [this issue tracker **aka _forum_**]({{ forum_link }})**, and cross-posted on IVLE.
  * Reason for using issue tracker for announcements/discussions: It allows you to post responses to announcements, and is a tool from the SE world
  * You are encouraged to _watch_ [that repo]({{ forum_link }}) to get alerts when new issues/comments are posted

  * You are encouraged to help others in the forum (e.g., share tips, help with technical problems). ==We consider such sharing when giving out `A+` grades and when recruiting tutors.==

* You are encouraged to **ask module-related questions in the [forum]({{ forum_link }}) or in the [slack channel]({{ slack_team }})** so that the discussion can benefit the whole class, instead of asking tutors directly. It is also safer to ask module-related questions here because there are subtle variations between semesters and there is a slight risk that a tutor's answer is outdated.
