* We start formal tutorials this week. The [tutorial time table](https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-website/admin/tutorials.html#tutorial-timetable) is on the module website.

* ==**There is graded project task** this week!==

* Note that the official {{ icon_deadline }} **deadline to achieve weekly project tasks is the midnight before your tutorial**. Our scripts that detect your work run at midnight and only the work that's done by midnight will be eligible for marks (for cases where the task is graded).

**CS2103 students only:**<br>

* **forming project teams will happen at the _start_ of this week's tutorial**; please try to arrive on time. If you are not there at the team forming time and others in the class are unaware which team you wanted to be in, we'll have to put you into a team randomly.
