* We start formal tutorials this week. The [tutorial time table](https://nuscs2113-ay1819s2.github.io/website/admin/tutorials.html#tutorial-timetable) is on the module website.

* ==**There is graded project task** this week!==

* Note that the official {{ icon_deadline }} **deadline to achieve weekly project tasks is the midnight before your tutorial**. Our scripts that detect your work run at midnight and only the work that's done by midnight will be eligible for marks (for cases where the task is graded).

**Team formation**<br>

* **We will form project teams at the _start_ of the tutorial this week**; please arrive on time. If you are not there at the team forming time we'll have to put you into a team randomly.
