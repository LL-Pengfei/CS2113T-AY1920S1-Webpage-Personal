## Simple Java exercises

If you need additional Java practise, you can work through the simple Java coding exercises on [repl.it](https://repl.it/).<br>
The [link to our classroom :glyphicon-blackboard:](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/5Nfgumx) will be available under *Links* in the navigation bar.<br>
%%Note: you need to create an account on repl.it to be able to use the platform%%

==These exercises are optional and not graded. If you choose to do it, please set your own pace.==
%%You may ask your tutors for help if necessary, outside of the tutorials%%

## Team forming

**All students**: 
* Confirm your team ID with the tutor. It should be of the form `MODULE-TUTORIAL_ID-TEAM_NUMBER` e.g, `CS2113T-W12-2` (`CS2113T` team from the `W`ed `12`00 slot, team `2`)
