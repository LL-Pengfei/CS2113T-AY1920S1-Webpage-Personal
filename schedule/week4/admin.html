                <ul>
                  <li>You are not allowed to share individual assignments with classmates directly.</li>
                  <li>You are not allowed to share project-related things with other teams directly.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>You can even reuse each other's work</strong> subject to the 'reuse policy' given below.</p>
                <p>If you submit code (or adopt ideas) taken from elsewhere, you need to comply with our reuse policy.</p>
                <p>Detection:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Detecting plagiarism in code is quite easy. You are not fooling anyone by reordering code or renaming methods/variables.</li>
                  <li>As all your work is publicly visible on GitHub, sooner or later somebody will notice the plagiarism.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Penalties:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>For submissions not affecting marks: We make a record of cases of plagiarism but we do not take further action. Such plagiarism does not disadvantage other students. Therefore, we prefer to spend all available resources on helping honest students to do better rather than to chase after dishonest students. If you think you gain something by plagiarizing, go ahead and do it. It's your choice and it's your loss.</li>
                  <li>For the final project/exam: Any case of claiming others' work as yours will be reported to the university for disciplinary action.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>You are allowed to reuse work from your classmates, subject to following conditions:

Acknowledge use of third party resources clearly e.g. in the welcome message, splash screen (if any) or under the 'about' menu. If you are open about reuse, you are less likely to get into trouble if you unintentionally reused something copyrighted.</li>
                      <li>You do not violate the license under which the work has been released. Please  <strong>do not use 3rd-party images/audio</strong> in your software unless they have been specifically released to be used freely.

Please post your 'request to use 3rd party library' in our <a href="https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1920S1/forum/issues">forum</a>.

These requirements are specific to this module <span class="dimmed"> i.e., not applicable outside the module (outside the module you should follow the rules specified by your employer and the license of the reused work)</span></p>
                  <p>If you <strong>used a third party library</strong>:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Mention in the <code>README.adoc</code> (under the <em>Acknowledgements</em> section)</li>
                    <li>mention in the <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:reusePolicy-ppp">Project Portfolio Page</trigger> if the library has a significant relevance to the features you implemented</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>If you <strong>reused code snippets found on the Internet</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g. from StackOverflow answers</span> or<br>
                    <strong>referred code in another software</strong> or<br>

For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part.

            <div class="full-mode">
              <p>Note that you have <strong>slightly more than ½ minute for each question</strong>, which means you need to go through the questions fairly quickly.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Given the fast pace required by the paper, to be fair to all students, <strong>you will not be allowed to clarify doubts about questions</strong> (in Part 1) by talking to invigilators.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If a question is not clear, you can circle the question number in the question paper and write your doubt in the question paper, near that question.</li>
              <li>If your doubt is justified <span class="dimmed">(e.g. there is a typo in the question)</span> or if many students found the question to be unclear, the examiner may decide to omit that question from grading.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Questions in Part 1 are confidential.</strong> You are not allowed to reveal Part 1 content to anyone after the exam. All pages of the assessment paper are to be returned at the end of the exam.</p>
            <div class="full-mode">
              <p>You will be given OCR forms <span class="dimmed">(i.e., bubble sheets)</span> to indicate your answers for Part 1. As each OCR form can accommodate only 50 answers, you will be given 2 OCR forms. <strong>Indicate your student number in both OCR forms</strong>.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Some questions will use <ins>underlines</ins> or <mark>highlighting</mark> to draw your attention to a specific part of the question. That is because those parts are highly relevant to the answer and we don’t want you to miss the relevance of that part.</p>
            <tip-box>
              <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> Consider the statement below:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>Technique ABC <ins>can</ins> be used to generate more test cases.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The word <ins>can</ins> is underlined because the decision you need to make is whether the ABC <em>can or cannot</em> be used to generate more test cases; the decision is not whether ABC can be used to generate <em>more or better</em> test cases.</p>
            </tip-box>
            <p><strong>The exam paper is open-book</strong>: you may bring any printed or written materials to the exam in hard copy format.
              However, given the fast pace required by Part 1, you will not have time left to refer notes during that part of the exam.</p>
            <p>💡 <strong>Mark the OCR form as you go</strong>, rather than planning to transfer your answers to the OCR form near the end. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: Given there are 100 questions, it will be hard to estimate how much time you need to mass-transfer all answers to OCR forms.</span></p>
            <p>💡 <strong>Write the answer in the exam paper as well</strong> when marking it in the OCR form. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: It will reduce the chance of missing a question. Furthermore, in case you missed a question, it will help you correct the OCR form quickly.</span></p>
            <p>💡 We have tried to <strong>avoid deliberately misleading/tricky questions</strong>. If a question seems to take a very long time to figure out, you are probably over-thinking it.</p>
            <box type="success">
              <p>You will be given a practice exam paper to familiarize yourself with this slightly unusual exam format.
