<tip-box type="important">

There are no tutorials or lecture this week due to CNY. <br>

However, do continue to make progress on the project front!

</tip-box>

* We will be adding you all to nus{{ module }}-{{ semester }} github org. **Please accept the invitation sent by GitHub**.
  * You need to be a member of the org for some of the future module activities. 
  * If you did not receive the invitation link, you can use the link [https://github.com/orgs/nus{{ module }}-{{ semester }}/invitation](https://github.com/orgs/nus{{ module }}-{{ semester }}/invitation). <br>

* Get started on the project (i.e., defining your project direction and requirements). **Try to do at least step 1 of [mid-v1.0 project milestone]({{ module_website }}/admin/project-w04-mid-v10.html)** immediately after CNY, and try to finish the remainder by the end of the week.

* A heads up: **next week is going to be HEAVY** ðŸ˜¨ as it has two graded tasks (and some spill over topics from CNY week) -- both require significant team efforts and a substantial time to complete. We urge you all to **make full use of this week to prepare yourself for that challenge**. In particular,
  * Try to reach [mid-v1.0]({{ module_website }}/admin/project-w04-mid-v10.html) fully by the end of this week i.e., complete all 3 steps.
  * If you are not familiar with Git and GitHub, complete this week's topics related to Git and GitHub. Next week's topics need that knowledge.<br>
