<tip-box type="important"> 

In this week's tutorial we would like to ensure that,
1. **_All_ students are able to create branch-based PRs without accidentally mixing commits** between PRs (a common mistake)
2. **_At least some members_ of the team are able to resolve merge conflicts and merge PRs**

%%Reason: These two skills are going to be essential for you in future weeks because most of your work will require creating PRs.%%

Therefore, we **strongly encourage you to achieve the `W4.1 Can create PRs on GitHub` before coming to the tutorial**. If not, you'll have to do it during the tutorial and then there will be less time for you to do the other activities we have planned for this tutorial

* This week we don't join teams during discussions, to give you more time to work with your own team members in preparation for the upcoming peer review in week 6.
* As before, discuss evidence of achieving LOs as directed by the tutor.

**Suggested question to discuss:**
