At this point we would like to ensure that **you are able to create branch-based PRs without accidentally mixing commits** between PRs (a common mistake)
Therefore, we **strongly encourage you to learn the topic: `W4.5 -> Pull requests` before attempting other exercises**.

<tip-box type="important"> 

There are no tutorials this week due to CNY. <br>
However, you are advised to set a time and meet with your team to complete the tasks for **mid-v1.0** and start working towards completing the first draft of the user guide.

# Suggested exercises

- The following exercises allow you to get used to larger codebase of Addressbook-Level2 and Addressbook-Level3 while at the same time introducing you to various OOP fundamentals.
  - You may feel intimidated by the number of exercises. However, please note that ==it is **not** mandatory to do all of these exercises==.
  - If you are comfortable with the topic you can skip the exercise.
  - You won't be graded for these exercises, but your tutors will provide feedback on your submissions.
- Please submit clean pull-requests to the respective upstream repositories (==take care to submit PRs to nusCS2113-AY1819S2/addressbook-levelX and not the se-edu upstream repo==) before the tutorial.
- During the tutorial, show to your tutor the evidence of learning the topic(s) and participate in relevant discussions.
