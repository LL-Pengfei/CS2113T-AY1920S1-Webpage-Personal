## ðŸ’° Participation points

**After reaching 15 participation points**:

* We encourage you to continue to do module activities (irrespective of whether they have participation points) because **every time you skip a module activity, it can potentially make the remainder of the module a harder for you** to follow, due to the highly-connect and iterative nature of this module.

## ðŸ†˜ Seeking help

**If you need help**

* Do **inform your tutor (or write to the module email) if you are falling behind or cannot cope with the module requirements**. While we try to avoid _hand holding_ or _spoon feeding_ students, we do want to help you keep up with the module pace when necessary.

* **If you encounter any technical difficulties when setting up AB-4**, please post in our forum so that AB-4 developers can follow up with you. Unlike in first year programming modules, there is no guarantee that tutors will know solutions to your technical problems -- it is not reasonable to even expect so. But you can increase your chances of a solution if you post in the forum as soon as you encounter them. Also, see [Admin Â» Appendix D: Getting Help in this Module ]({{ module_website }}/admin/appendixD-help.html#d-getting-help-in-this-module)

## Tutorials

* Tutorials this week will be most effective if you work out the tutorial questions beforehand. You can discuss your answers with your team and your tutor during the tutorial.

<!--

## Graded coding exercise

- This week you need to make an enhancement to Addressbook-Level3; this can earn you 3 participation points.

- Though the deadline is Week 7 before the tutorial, you are strongly encouraged to finish this soon, so that you have enough time to work on the project.

- Refer to the project tab for more details.

## ðŸ’¹ Project progress

* To get you up to speed to work with AB-4, **we recommend you to play around with the AB-3 code base** (i.e., fork, clone, setup, and enhance)  before moving to AB-4.  You can practice with AB-3 while at the the same time updating docs of AB-4 as required by the next project milestone.

* At this point of the project there are several non-trivial tools you need to learn e.g., JavaFX, Gradle, Travis, Java 8 features, Git, etc. We recommend that you **divide up the learning tasks among team members and plan to learn them gradually** over the next few weeks.

* Be reminded that **your performance in meeting individual/team project milestones** (as detected by our scripts and observed by tutors) **will be counted towards your [project grade under the _project management_ component]({{ module_website }}/admin/project-assessment.html)**. Please do follow exact setup instructions because deviations will affect our script's ability to detect your work.

#### Using AB-3?

* If you choose to use AB-3 for your project, be informed that there will be no disadvantage in terms of marks (i.e., you will not be penalized for starting from AB-3). 

* However some points to take note:
  * Some of the project infrastructure that is readily available in AB-4 will not be available in AB-3. You need to set it up yourself.
  * Adding features/commands available in AB-4 but not in AB-3 **alone** to your project does not earn credits.
