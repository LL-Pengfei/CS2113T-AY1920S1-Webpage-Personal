* The [Project List Page]({{ module_website }}/admin/projectList.html) will be up this week.

**If your photo or your UI mock-up does not appear in the page**, you have not followed our instructions correctly. 'Close enough' is sometimes not 'good enough'. Please rectify before v1.1 deadline. In particular,
  * Please **follow our guidelines for your photo**. If not, the photo will not serve its intended purpose (i.e., for others to identify you).
  * Please **limit the `Ui.png` to one screenshot only**, so that your UI mockup takes roughly the same amount of space as other teams' in the Teams Page.

**v1.1 milestone deadline is coming up soon**: Refer to v1.1 instructions carefully and try to follow as closely as you can. However, there is no lower bar on the code changes you need to do. Even a tiny change is acceptable. Use that flexibility to control your workload.
