## Coding exercise

- Complete the coding exercise for 3kLoC enhancement  before the tutorial this week (refer to [Week 6]({{ module_website }}/schedule/week6/index.html) Project tab) for details.

## The Project List Page

* The [Project List Page]({{ module_website }}/admin/projectList.html) will be up this week.

**If your photo or your UI mock-up does not appear in the page**, you have not followed our instructions correctly. 'Close enough' is sometimes not 'good enough'. Please rectify before v1.1 deadline. In particular,
  * Please **follow our guidelines for your photo**. If not, the photo will not serve its intended purpose (i.e., for others to identify you).
  * Please **limit the `Ui.png` to one screenshot only**, so that your UI mockup takes roughly the same amount of space as other teams' in the Teams Page.

**v1.1 milestone deadline is coming up soon**: Refer to v1.1 instructions carefully and try to follow as closely as you can. However, there is no lower bar on the code changes you need to do. Even a tiny change is acceptable. Use that flexibility to control your workload.

## Mid-semester feedback session

* **Peer Evaluation Round 1** will open on TEAMMATES. You will receive the submission link soon. **If you do not submit feedback responses, you will forfeit participation marks that you earned based on feedback ratings received from others**.
  * The expectations are two fold. First, we hope you will give a honest and constructive feedback to your teammates to help them improve. 
  Second, we hope that you will use the feedback you received to be an effective team player.

<br>

* **An anonymous survey to submit feedback about the teaching team** will be open on LumiNUS. Please take a few minutes to give feedback to your tutors and the lecturer.
  * We will use your feedback to adapt some teaching strategies so that you will be benefited.
