## Lecture this week

* **One part of this week's lecture is not covered in the textbook** and is relevant for your project work for the upcoming project milestone v1.0. You are encouraged to attend this week's lecture even if you don't normally come to lectures.

## Tutorials

**Come prepared for the tutorial**:

* This week's tutorial involves discussing some theory questions. There are 5 questions (listed under Tutorial 8 in the [schedule page](https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-website/index.html)). **Please divide the questions among yourselves and come prepared to answer them during the tutorial.** We will not be able to finish all five questions during the tutorial unless you come prepared.

**Project**

* **You are expected to start proper project planning and tracking after v1.1**. See [mid-v1.2 instructions]({{ module_website }}/admin/project-w08-mid-v12.html) and please follow them carefully.

* **Try to achieve all milestone requirements, but do not fret if you miss a few**.  You will get full marks as long as you achieve about 60% of the milestone requirements on average. Yes, that's a pretty low bar, but we have set it low in order to reduce workload and stress. Ideally, you should achieve close to 80-90%.
