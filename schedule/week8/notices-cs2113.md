## Lecture this week

* **One part of this week's lecture is not covered in the textbook** and is relevant for your project. You are encouraged to attend this week's lecture even if you don't normally come to lectures.


## Project

* **You are expected to start proper project planning and tracking after v1.1**. See [mid-v1.2 instructions]({{ module_website }}/admin/project-w08-mid-v12.html) and please follow them carefully.

* **Try to achieve all milestone requirements, but do not fret if you miss a few**.  You will get full marks as long as you achieve about 60% of the milestone requirements on average. Yes, that's a pretty low bar, but we have set it low in order to reduce workload and stress. Ideally, you should achieve close to 80-90%.
