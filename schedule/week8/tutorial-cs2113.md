# Suggested tutorial activities

### Project management - Issue tracker

- Setup the issue tracker as per the [instructions]({{ module_website }}/admin/appendixE-gitHub.html#issue-tracker-setup), if you haven't done yet.
- Record all your user stories as issues.
- Try to identify `type.Epic` issues from corresponding `type.Story`.
- Assign priority labels to all the issues.
- Split the `type.Story` issues to `type.Task`.

### Project management - Scheduling

- Create milestones: `v1.1`, `v1.2`, `v1.3`, `v1.4`, and set the deadline to be the day before your tutorial in weeks  7, 9, 11 and 13.
- At minimum, assign some `type.Epic` or `type.Story` issues to each milestone.
  - (Preferred) assign all `type.Story`, `type.Epic` and `type.Task` issues to each milestone.
- Assign at least one owner to each `type.Story` and `type.Task` to all the issues in `v1.2`.
