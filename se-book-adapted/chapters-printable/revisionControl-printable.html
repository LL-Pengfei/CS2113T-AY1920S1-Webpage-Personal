          <p><strong><em>Revision Control Software (RCS)</em> are the software tools that automate the process of <em>Revision Control</em> i.e. managing revisions of software artifacts.</strong></p>
          <p>Revision control is also known as <em>Version Control Software (VCS)</em>, and a few other names. Here, we use the terms <em>revision</em> and <em>version</em> interchangeably.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p><em>Revision control</em> is the process of managing multiple versions of a piece of information. In its simplest form, this is something that many people do by hand: every time you modify a file, save it under a new name that contains
                  a number, each one higher than the number of the preceding version.</p>
                <p>Manually managing multiple versions of even a single file is an error-prone task, though, so software tools to help automate this process have long been available. The earliest automated revision control tools were intended to help a single
                  user to manage revisions of a single file. Over the past few decades, the scope of revision control tools has expanded greatly; they now manage multiple files, and help multiple people to work together. The best modern revision control
                  tools have no problem coping with thousands of people working together on projects that consist of hundreds of thousands of files.</p>
                <p>There are a number of reasons why you or your team might want to use an automated revision control tool for a project. It will track the history and evolution of your project, so you don't have to. For every change, you'll have a log of
                  who made it; why they made it; when they made it; and what the change was.</p>
                <p>When you're working with other people, <strong>revision control software makes it easier for you to collaborate</strong>. For example, when people more or less simultaneously make potentially incompatible changes, the software will help
                  you to identify and resolve those conflicts.</p>
                <p><strong>It can help you to recover from mistakes</strong>. If you make a change that later turns out to be an error, you can revert to an earlier version of one or more files. In fact, a really good revision control tool will even help
                  you to efficiently figure out exactly when a problem was introduced.</p>
                <p><strong>It will help you to work simultaneously on, and manage the drift between, multiple versions of your project.</strong> Most of these reasons are equally valid, at least in theory, whether you're working on a project by yourself,
                  or with a hundred other people.</p>

              <p>Suppose you want to apply revision control on files in a directory called <code>ProjectFoo</code>.

          <p><strong>Centralized RCS (CRCS for short)uses a central remote repo that is shared by the team.</strong> Team members download (‘pull’) and upload (‘push’) changes between their own local repositories and the central repository. Older RCS tools
            such as CVS and SVN support only this model. Note that these older RCS do not support the notion of a local repo either. Instead, they force users to do all the versioning with the remote repo.</p>

          <p><strong>Distributed RCS (DRCS for short, also known as Decentralized RCS) allows multiple remote repos</strong> and pulling and pushing can be done among them in arbitrary ways. The workflow can vary differently from team to team. For example,
            every team member can have his/her own remote repository in addition to their own local repository, as shown in the diagram below. Git and Mercurial are some prominent RCS tools that support the distributed approach.</p>

          <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let’s assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>

            <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean’s code to the main repo.</li>
            <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>
